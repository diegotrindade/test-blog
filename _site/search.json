Therefore, being able to wrangling, analyzing and visualizing this data, associated with a good scientific question, is timely for ecologists. Here, I will introduce some tidyverse packages and functions that can make this part of the job a bit easier.\nMost information I will present here was gotten from our outstanding R community (StackOverflow, GitHub, Twitter posts - #rstats - and R books), based on daily issues faced during my PhD. Also, everything here can be achieved by using base R. However, some tidyverse packages can be helpful to avoid unnecessary loops and functions, saving some lines of code and time. The intention of this post is, therefore, to show some useful functions that can facilitate our life but also to gather information in one place for my own purpose :).\nIn this post, I will be using the BioTime database as an example, which is a biodiversity time series data with multiple taxa and several sites around the world (more details at: http://biotime.st-andrews.ac.uk/). I anticipate that this is not an extensive analysis of the data but just an example of how we can use some tidyverse packages and functions to any data we want. Please download both data and metadata, in case you want to follow this post.\nThis post is split into three parts:\n\n1st: Presenting here, archive and vroom packages and how to wrangling/exploring data with dplyr and purrr\n2nd: Data visualization with ggplot2 and cowplot\n3rd: Statistical modelling and bootstraps with tidymodels::broom\n\n\nhere package\nFor those using R projects, here is quite handy. With here we don’t need to set our working directory (setwd) anymore. This is particularly interesting whether we are collaborating and have to share our scripts and data with colleagues or need to read files saved at different folders and work on different computers. When using here we only need to set the path where the files are saved within the R project:\nFor example, let’s say the project is in “MyFolder” and the data in “data”. Using the traditional way, before starting working on the data, we would have to set up the working directory:\n\nsetwd(\"C:\\Users\\yourname\\Desktop\\MyFolder\\data\")\n\nmyfile <- read.csv(\"myfile.csv\")\n\nWith here, instead of setting the working directory (setwd) and read the file afterwards (read.csv), we can go straight to the file part.\nFor instance, the project is in “MyFolder” and we saved your file in “data”. You can simply read your file as:\n\nmyfile <- read.csv(here(\"data\", \"myfile.csv\"), header=T, sep=\";\")\n\nor\n\nmyfile <- read.csv(here(\"data\\myfile.csv\", header=T, sep=\";\"))\n\nIf you have a file in a folder within the “data” folder you just need to add this new “path”:\n\nmyfile2 <- read.csv(here(\"data\", \"differentfolder\", \n                         \"mysecondfile.csv\"), header=T, sep=\";\")\n\nYou can use this for everything you want and it helps to keep files organized within your project. For instance, to save figures, you simply create a new folder to store figures and change the path (i.e. “data” by “figures”):\n\nggsave(here(\"figures\", file = \"fig1.png\"), fig_object)\n\n\n\nFile size\nSpecially if you are storing your projects on GitHub, large files can be annoying, since GitHub allows us to store files up to 100 mb. To tackle this issue, we can either use the lfs storage method (more details at: https://git-lfs.github.com) or compress the data as .zip or .gz files. Sometimes, though, the file is too large that even after compressing it, you still need to use the lsf method to push it to GitHub - which is the biotime case. Anyway, it is good to know how to compress your files in case you need it for a different data.\nThere are different ways to do that in R. I’m going to use here the archive package. This package is a good alternative for both compressing and reading data.\nAs the biotime file is already zipped, let’s use the metadata as an example.\nFirst we read the file\n\nmetadata <- read.csv(here(\"posts\", \"rstats\", \n                          \"biotime_meta.csv\"), header=T, sep=\",\") \n\n\nNote that I’m using the path where my project is saved at.\n\nTo compress this file you have to use the archive_write function:\n\n#renv::install(\"archive\")\nlibrary(archive)\nwrite_csv(metadata, archive_write(\"metadata.zip\", \"metadata.csv\"))\n\nI saved the file as .zip, but you can use .gz or other formats. More information at: https://github.com/jimhester/archive\nThe biotime file is already compressed (134 mb). If you extract the .csv, the size will increase to more than 1gb. Working with compressed files can save a lot of time and space when pushing it to GitHub, as I said before.\n\n\nvroom\nIf you don’t want to extract the .csv file but read it in the compressed format (e.g. .zip, .gz etc), there are different ways to do so. I’m going to use the vroom package to do the job (faster) - other options would be readr package or fread() function in data.table package.\nFor reading the .zip file we simply change from read.csv(base R) to vroom.\n\n#devtools::install_dev(\"vroom\")\nlibrary(vroom)\n\nbiotime_df <- vroom(here(\"posts\", \"rstats\", \n                         \"biotime.zip\"), delim = \",\")\n\nbiotime_metadata <- vroom(here(\"posts\", \"rstats\", \n                               \"biotime_meta.csv\"), delim = \",\")\n\n\n\nCleaning and exploring BioTime with dplyr\ndplyr is a very useful package to clean and explore data in R. I’m not going to spend much time talking about this package because there are many other great material available out there. Rather, I will just show some important functions, specially for beginner users. You can check a detailed information about this package at: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org\nWith dplyr we can select and rename columns, filter lines, create new variables and make plenty of cool/complex stuff. Throughout this post, I’m going to use mostly select, filter, group_by and mutate/summarize.\nLet’s start by cleaning both data and metadata using some dplyr functions. There are many columns in both files and I’m going to select only those I’m interested in. For that, we can use select:\n\nbiotime <- biotime_df %>% \n  select(id = STUDY_ID, year = YEAR, plot = PLOT, \n         abundance = sum.allrawdata.ABUNDANCE, \n         biomass = sum.allrawdata.BIOMASS, sp = GENUS_SPECIES)\n\n\nmetadata <- biotime_metadata %>% \n  select(STUDY_ID:ORGANISMS, CENT_LAT, CENT_LONG) %>% \n  rename(id = STUDY_ID)\n\nIf you are not used to dplyr, this %>% is called pipe, and we can use it to nest our functions. We first select the object we want, then use the %>% to nest more functions, separating each one by a new pipe, like I did to create the metadata object.\nNow, in biotime object, we have species’ name, abundance, plot, year and site.\n\nhead(biotime)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n     id  year plot  abundance biomass sp             \n  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>          \n1    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer rubrum    \n2    10  1984 12            3       0 Acer saccharum \n3    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer spicatum  \n4    10  1984 12           12       0 Corylus cornuta\n5    10  1984 12            1       0 Populus pinnata\n6    10  1984 12           20       0 Acer rubrum    \n\n\nWhereas in metadata we have realm, taxa, habitat, whether the area is protected or not etc.\n\nhead(biotime_metadata)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 38\n  STUDY_ID REALM  CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA BIOME_MAP TAXA  ORGANISMS TITLE\n     <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>          <chr>     <chr> <chr>     <chr>\n1       10 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Temperat… Terr… woody pl… Wind…\n2       18 Terre… Temper… Sagebr… FALSE          Deserts … Terr… sagebrus… Mapp…\n3       33 Marine Temper… Seawee… FALSE          Temperat… Mari… phytopla… Long…\n4       39 Terre… Temper… Decidu… FALSE          Temperat… Birds birds     Bird…\n5       41 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Temperat… Birds birds     Time…\n6       45 Marine Tropic… Reef    FALSE          Tropical… Fish  tropical… MCR …\n# ℹ 29 more variables: AB_BIO <chr>, HAS_PLOT <chr>, DATA_POINTS <dbl>,\n#   START_YEAR <dbl>, END_YEAR <dbl>, CENT_LAT <dbl>, CENT_LONG <dbl>,\n#   NUMBER_OF_SPECIES <dbl>, NUMBER_OF_SAMPLES <dbl>, NUMBER_LAT_LONG <dbl>,\n#   TOTAL <dbl>, GRAIN_SIZE_TEXT <chr>, GRAIN_SQ_KM <dbl>, AREA_SQ_KM <dbl>,\n#   CONTACT_1 <chr>, CONTACT_2 <chr>, CONT_1_MAIL <chr>, CONT_2_MAIL <chr>,\n#   LICENSE <chr>, WEB_LINK <chr>, DATA_SOURCE <chr>, METHODS <chr>,\n#   SUMMARY_METHODS <chr>, LINK_ID <dbl>, COMMENTS <chr>, …\n\n\n\nNote that, in biotime object, I took the opportunity and renamed the columns within select. You can also use rename if you want (as I did in metadata object). Also, if you have to rename/fix several column names, you can use the janitor package.\n\nWe use select for columns and filter for rows. Let´s say we are interested only in Terrestrial plants from the metadata. We can go for:\n\nmetadata %>% \nfilter(TAXA == \"Terrestrial plants\") %>% \nhead()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n     id REALM  CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA BIOME_MAP TAXA  ORGANISMS CENT_LAT\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>          <chr>     <chr> <chr>        <dbl>\n1    10 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Temperat… Terr… woody pl…    47.4 \n2    18 Terre… Temper… Sagebr… FALSE          Deserts … Terr… sagebrus…    44.3 \n3    60 Terre… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE          Tropical… Terr… tropical…     9.15\n4   201 Terre… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE          Tropical… Terr… Tropical…     2.98\n5   202 Terre… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE          Tropical… Terr… Tropical…    11.6 \n6   214 Terre… Temper… Conife… FALSE          Temperat… Terr… Trees        45.3 \n# ℹ 1 more variable: CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nOf course we can add more arguments to the filter, for example, only terrestrial plants in tropical climate and so on.\n\nmetadata %>% \nfilter(TAXA == \"Terrestrial plants\",\n       CLIMATE == \"Tropical\") %>% \nhead()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n     id REALM  CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA BIOME_MAP TAXA  ORGANISMS CENT_LAT\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>          <chr>     <chr> <chr>        <dbl>\n1    60 Terre… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE          Tropical… Terr… tropical…     9.15\n2   201 Terre… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE          Tropical… Terr… Tropical…     2.98\n3   202 Terre… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE          Tropical… Terr… Tropical…    11.6 \n4   241 Terre… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE          Tropical… Terr… Woody pl…     9.36\n5   302 Terre… Tropic… Semi d… TRUE           Tropical… Terr… Trees       -22.4 \n6   322 Terre… Tropic… Semi d… TRUE           Tropical… Terr… Trees       -22.8 \n# ℹ 1 more variable: CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nWe can also do the opposite (filter rows out), adding ! to the column’s name:\n\nmetadata %>% \nfilter(!TAXA == \"Terrestrial plants\",\n       !CLIMATE == \"Tropical\") %>% \nhead()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n     id REALM  CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA BIOME_MAP TAXA  ORGANISMS CENT_LAT\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>          <chr>     <chr> <chr>        <dbl>\n1    33 Marine Temper… Seawee… FALSE          Temperat… Mari… phytopla…     50.2\n2    39 Terre… Temper… Decidu… FALSE          Temperat… Birds birds         43.9\n3    41 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Temperat… Birds birds         39.5\n4    46 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Temperat… Birds breeding…     51.7\n5    47 Terre… Temper… Ponds   FALSE          Temperat… Birds ducks         50.8\n6    51 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Boreal f… Birds tetraoni…     61.9\n# ℹ 1 more variable: CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nWe can filter values higher or lower than:\n\nmetadata %>% \nfilter(id > 100) %>% \nhead()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n     id REALM  CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA BIOME_MAP TAXA  ORGANISMS CENT_LAT\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>          <chr>     <chr> <chr>        <dbl>\n1   108 Marine Global  Oceani… FALSE          Multiple… Birds birds       -27.2 \n2   110 Marine Temper… Estuar… FALSE          Temperat… Bent… Benthos      55.5 \n3   112 Marine Temper… Pelagi… FALSE          Multiple… Fish  pelagic …    25.0 \n4   113 Marine Global  Oceani… FALSE          Multiple… Mari… marine i…     2.70\n5   117 Marine Temper… Tidal … FALSE          Temperat… Mari… Starfish    -39.4 \n6   119 Marine Temper… Pelagi… FALSE          Temperat… Fish  Fish         44.0 \n# ℹ 1 more variable: CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nSometimes we need to filter several specific rows.

Let’s filter only the study number 10 and create a new column to check how many species and years they have sampled in this study. We can use mutate and n_distinct() to achieve that.\n\nbiotime %>% \n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  mutate(total_sp = n_distinct(sp),\n         total_y = n_distinct(year))\n\n# A tibble: 1,406 × 8\n      id  year plot  abundance biomass sp                     total_sp total_y\n   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>                     <int>   <int>\n 1    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer rubrum                  25       3\n 2    10  1984 12            3       0 Acer saccharum               25       3\n 3    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer spicatum                25       3\n 4    10  1984 12           12       0 Corylus cornuta              25       3\n 5    10  1984 12            1       0 Populus pinnata              25       3\n 6    10  1984 12           20       0 Acer rubrum                  25       3\n 7    10  1984 12           14       0 Acer saccharum               25       3\n 8    10  1984 12            1       0 Toxicodendron radicans       25       3\n 9    10  1984 12            5       0 Acer spicatum                25       3\n10    10  1984 12            7       0 Corylus cornuta              25       3\n# ℹ 1,396 more rows\n\n\nIn this study we have 25 species and three different years.\nNow let’s say we want to know how many species we have per year. To get that, we can use the function group_by.\n\nbiotime %>% \n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  group_by(year) %>% \n  mutate(total_sp = n_distinct(sp))\n\n# A tibble: 1,406 × 7\n# Groups:   year [3]\n      id  year plot  abundance biomass sp                     total_sp\n   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>                     <int>\n 1    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer rubrum                  22\n 2    10  1984 12            3       0 Acer saccharum               22\n 3    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer spicatum                22\n 4    10  1984 12           12       0 Corylus cornuta              22\n 5    10  1984 12            1       0 Populus pinnata              22\n 6    10  1984 12           20       0 Acer rubrum                  22\n 7    10  1984 12           14       0 Acer saccharum               22\n 8    10  1984 12            1       0 Toxicodendron radicans       22\n 9    10  1984 12            5       0 Acer spicatum                22\n10    10  1984 12            7       0 Corylus cornuta              22\n# ℹ 1,396 more rows\n\n\nWe can see that we have 22 species in 1984, 20 species in 1992, we can’t see the third year though. That’s because mutate creates a new column and repeats the values for each row we have. To get a summarized overview, we can use summarise instead.\n\nbiotime %>% \n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  group_by(year) %>% \n  summarise(total_sp = n_distinct(sp))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n   year total_sp\n  <dbl>    <int>\n1  1984       22\n2  1992       20\n3  1996       20\n\n\nNow we can see the number of species per year, but the other columns were deleted. Therefore, both mutate and summaries give us the same result but in different ways, you have to choose which one fits better your purpose when dealing with the data.\nWe can also combine summarise and mutate to get, for example, the frequency of species\n\nbiotime %>%\n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  group_by(sp) %>% \n  summarise (total = n()) %>%\n  mutate(freq = total / sum(total))\n\n# A tibble: 25 × 3\n   sp                  total     freq\n   <chr>               <int>    <dbl>\n 1 Acer rubrum           185 0.132   \n 2 Acer saccharum        290 0.206   \n 3 Acer spicatum         146 0.104   \n 4 Amelanchier gravida     1 0.000711\n 5 Amelanchier laevis     30 0.0213  \n 6 Betula papyrifera      10 0.00711 \n 7 Cornus racemosa         6 0.00427 \n 8 Cornus rugosa          35 0.0249  \n 9 Corylus cornuta       244 0.174   \n10 Diervilla lonicera     14 0.00996 \n# ℹ 15 more rows\n\n\nNote that I’ve grouped by “species”.

Knowing how to transform the data into both formats, in R, is very handy and safe, because we don’t need to create several .csv files, maintaining the original data intact, decreasing the chances of messing up it.\nThe most important functions to transform data frames in tidy are pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(). These functions have been improved constantly. Out there, you will find reshape2 package, melt, spread and gather. Those are the old school functions to transform data frames. I’m slowly moving from spread/gather into pivot_wider()/pivot_longer(). Then, let’s try to transform our data into both wide and long formats using the new functions.\nLet’s use the same example (study id 10) to transform the data into the wide format. We use pivot_wider(), specifying that the species names present in “sp” column will be the columns of the new object (names_from = \"sp\") and the values present in “abundance” will be the row values (values_from = \"abundance\").\n\nbiotime %>% \n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"sp\", values_from = \"abundance\")\n\n# A tibble: 47 × 29\n      id  year plot  biomass `Acer rubrum` `Acer saccharum` `Acer spicatum`\n   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>   <dbl> <list>        <list>           <list>         \n 1    10  1984 12          0 <dbl [4]>     <dbl [3]>        <dbl [2]>      \n 2    10  1984 1           0 <dbl [4]>     <dbl [4]>        <dbl [4]>      \n 3    10  1984 2           0 <dbl [4]>     <dbl [8]>        <dbl [8]>      \n 4    10  1984 34          0 <dbl [4]>     <dbl [6]>        <dbl [8]>      \n 5    10  1984 35          0 <dbl [4]>     <dbl [10]>       <dbl [5]>      \n 6    10  1984 36          0 <dbl [4]>     <dbl [8]>        <NULL>         \n 7    10  1984 37          0 <dbl [3]>     <dbl [10]>       <NULL>         \n 8    10  1984 38          0 <dbl [4]>     <dbl [6]>        <NULL>         \n 9    10  1984 39          0 <dbl [3]>     <dbl [4]>        <NULL>         \n10    10  1984 40          0 <dbl [2]>     <dbl [2]>        <dbl [6]>      \n# ℹ 37 more rows\n# ℹ 22 more variables: `Corylus cornuta` <list>, `Populus pinnata` <list>,\n#   `Toxicodendron radicans` <list>, `Diervilla lonicera` <list>,\n#   `Populus sp` <list>, `Cornus rugosa` <list>, `Prunus virginiana` <list>,\n#   `Rubus flagellaris` <list>, `Viburnum rafinesquianum` <list>,\n#   `Quercus rubra` <list>, `Vaccinium angustifolium` <list>,\n#   `Pinus strobus` <list>, `Ostrya virginiana` <list>, …\n\n\nOops.. something went wrong. It transformed our data frame but in an odd way. The warning says that our data is not uniquely identified, meaning that the function can’t recognize each row, separately, in our data frame. To tackle this issue, we can simply bring the row names to a column, identifying each row, with the function rownames_to_column(). Let´s try again.\n\nbiotime %>% \n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  rownames_to_column() %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"sp\", values_from = \"abundance\")\n\n# A tibble: 1,406 × 30\n   rowname    id  year plot  biomass `Acer rubrum` `Acer saccharum`\n   <chr>   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>         <dbl>            <dbl>\n 1 1          10  1984 12          0             1               NA\n 2 2          10  1984 12          0            NA                3\n 3 3          10  1984 12          0            NA               NA\n 4 4          10  1984 12          0            NA               NA\n 5 5          10  1984 12          0            NA               NA\n 6 6          10  1984 12          0            20               NA\n 7 7          10  1984 12          0            NA               14\n 8 8          10  1984 12          0            NA               NA\n 9 9          10  1984 12          0            NA               NA\n10 10         10  1984 12          0            NA               NA\n# ℹ 1,396 more rows\n# ℹ 23 more variables: `Acer spicatum` <dbl>, `Corylus cornuta` <dbl>,\n#   `Populus pinnata` <dbl>, `Toxicodendron radicans` <dbl>,\n#   `Diervilla lonicera` <dbl>, `Populus sp` <dbl>, `Cornus rugosa` <dbl>,\n#   `Prunus virginiana` <dbl>, `Rubus flagellaris` <dbl>,\n#   `Viburnum rafinesquianum` <dbl>, `Quercus rubra` <dbl>,\n#   `Vaccinium angustifolium` <dbl>, `Pinus strobus` <dbl>, …\n\n\nOk. It seems we are getting closer. Now we have the study 10 data frame in the wide format but when the species is absent we have NA’s. To tackle this, we add the argument values_fill to our pivot_wider() function.\n\nbiotime %>% \n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  rownames_to_column() %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"sp\", values_from = \"abundance\", \n              values_fill = list(abundance=0))\n\n# A tibble: 1,406 × 30\n   rowname    id  year plot  biomass `Acer rubrum` `Acer saccharum`\n   <chr>   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>         <dbl>            <dbl>\n 1 1          10  1984 12          0             1                0\n 2 2          10  1984 12          0             0                3\n 3 3          10  1984 12          0             0                0\n 4 4          10  1984 12          0             0                0\n 5 5          10  1984 12          0             0                0\n 6 6          10  1984 12          0            20                0\n 7 7          10  1984 12          0             0               14\n 8 8          10  1984 12          0             0                0\n 9 9          10  1984 12          0             0                0\n10 10         10  1984 12          0             0                0\n# ℹ 1,396 more rows\n# ℹ 23 more variables: `Acer spicatum` <dbl>, `Corylus cornuta` <dbl>,\n#   `Populus pinnata` <dbl>, `Toxicodendron radicans` <dbl>,\n#   `Diervilla lonicera` <dbl>, `Populus sp` <dbl>, `Cornus rugosa` <dbl>,\n#   `Prunus virginiana` <dbl>, `Rubus flagellaris` <dbl>,\n#   `Viburnum rafinesquianum` <dbl>, `Quercus rubra` <dbl>,\n#   `Vaccinium angustifolium` <dbl>, `Pinus strobus` <dbl>, …\n\n\nNow we have the data transformed into the wide format, with 0’s instead of NA’s. Note that, sometimes, the row names are names instead of numbers (i.e. sometimes we use species names as row names). If you face that, you can create a new column, labeling the rows, using mutate() and row_number() instead of rownames_to_column(). For example:\n\nbiotime_wider <- biotime %>% \n  filter(id == 10) %>%\n  #rownames_to_column() %>% \n  mutate(id_rows = row_number()) %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = \"sp\", values_from = \"abundance\", values_fill = list(abundance=0))\n\nNow let´s transform our data into the other way round, from wide into long format. For that, we can use the function pivot_longer()\n\nbiotime_wider %>% \n  pivot_longer(names_to = \"sp\", values_to = \"abundance\")\n\nError in `pivot_longer()`:\n! `cols` must select at least one column.\n\n\nError. When pivoting longer, we have to pay attention to the other columns we may have. In the biotime_wider object we have id, year, plot, biomass, id_rows and species names. We want to transform only species names and values (abundance) though. In this case, we have to omit the other columns we don’t want to transform.\n\nbiotime_wider %>% \n  pivot_longer(-c(id:id_rows),names_to = \"sp\", values_to = \"abundance\")\n\n# A tibble: 35,150 × 7\n      id  year plot  biomass id_rows sp                     abundance\n   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>   <int> <chr>                      <dbl>\n 1    10  1984 12          0       1 Acer rubrum                    1\n 2    10  1984 12          0       1 Acer saccharum                 0\n 3    10  1984 12          0       1 Acer spicatum                  0\n 4    10  1984 12          0       1 Corylus cornuta                0\n 5    10  1984 12          0       1 Populus pinnata                0\n 6    10  1984 12          0       1 Toxicodendron radicans         0\n 7    10  1984 12          0       1 Diervilla lonicera             0\n 8    10  1984 12          0       1 Populus sp                     0\n 9    10  1984 12          0       1 Cornus rugosa                  0\n10    10  1984 12          0       1 Prunus virginiana              0\n# ℹ 35,140 more rows\n\n\nWith pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() you can make a lot of more complex transformations, I’m not going to cover those here though, please check them out at: https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_wider.html\n\n\nMerging data and working within lists with purrr\nNow let´s try to use this knowledge to create more complex objects, using new features, combining functions etc.\nWhen analyzing ecological data, most of the time, both data and metadata are useful, like in BioTime example.\nLet’s check both data frames\nBioTime data\n\nhead(biotime)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n     id  year plot  abundance biomass sp             \n  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>          \n1    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer rubrum    \n2    10  1984 12            3       0 Acer saccharum \n3    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer spicatum  \n4    10  1984 12           12       0 Corylus cornuta\n5    10  1984 12            1       0 Populus pinnata\n6    10  1984 12           20       0 Acer rubrum    \n\n\nMetadata\n\nhead(metadata)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n     id REALM  CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA BIOME_MAP TAXA  ORGANISMS CENT_LAT\n  <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>          <chr>     <chr> <chr>        <dbl>\n1    10 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Temperat… Terr… woody pl…     47.4\n2    18 Terre… Temper… Sagebr… FALSE          Deserts … Terr… sagebrus…     44.3\n3    33 Marine Temper… Seawee… FALSE          Temperat… Mari… phytopla…     50.2\n4    39 Terre… Temper… Decidu… FALSE          Temperat… Birds birds         43.9\n5    41 Terre… Temper… Woodla… FALSE          Temperat… Birds birds         39.5\n6    45 Marine Tropic… Reef    FALSE          Tropical… Fish  tropical…    -17.5\n# ℹ 1 more variable: CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nAs you can see, in biotime we have id, year, plot, abundance, biomass and species, whereas in metadata we have id, realm, habitat etc. So, let’s say we are interested in examining terrestrial plants species from tropical forests, but as species are in one data frame and biomes in the other, we first have to merge both data frames. For merging data frames into one we can use either bind_cols() / bind_rows() functions, for binding columns and rows, respectively, or the join family available in dplyr (https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/join.html). Here, we can use the letf_join() option to merge both data and metadata.\n\nmerge_df <- left_join(biotime, metadata, by = \"id\")\nhead(merge_df)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 15\n     id  year plot  abundance biomass sp    REALM CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA\n  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>         \n1    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer… Terr… Temper… Woodla… FALSE         \n2    10  1984 12            3       0 Acer… Terr… Temper… Woodla… FALSE         \n3    10  1984 12            1       0 Acer… Terr… Temper… Woodla… FALSE         \n4    10  1984 12           12       0 Cory… Terr… Temper… Woodla… FALSE         \n5    10  1984 12            1       0 Popu… Terr… Temper… Woodla… FALSE         \n6    10  1984 12           20       0 Acer… Terr… Temper… Woodla… FALSE         \n# ℹ 5 more variables: BIOME_MAP <chr>, TAXA <chr>, ORGANISMS <chr>,\n#   CENT_LAT <dbl>, CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nleft_join() merged the data frames based on the study id. This is a safe way to merge data frames because the function will match exactly the same rows present in each data frame based on the argument you give in \"by = ...\"; in this case I chose by = \"id\", but depending on your data you can add more variables.\nNow we have both data and metadata merged. Then, we can finally check terrestrial plant species from tropical forests.\n\nmerge_df %>% \n  filter(TAXA == \"Terrestrial plants\",\n       CLIMATE == \"Tropical\") %>% \nhead()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 15\n     id  year plot  abundance biomass sp    REALM CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA\n  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>         \n1   201  1987 <NA>       2454       0 Aidi… Terr… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE         \n2   201  1987 <NA>         97       0 Fagr… Terr… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE         \n3   201  1987 <NA>        112       0 Fahr… Terr… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE         \n4   201  1987 <NA>         45       0 Ficu… Terr… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE         \n5   201  1987 <NA>       2913       0 Alan… Terr… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE         \n6   201  1987 <NA>          3       0 Ficu… Terr… Tropic… Tropic… FALSE         \n# ℹ 5 more variables: BIOME_MAP <chr>, TAXA <chr>, ORGANISMS <chr>,\n#   CENT_LAT <dbl>, CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nor Birds etc\n\nmerge_df %>% \nfilter(TAXA == \"Birds\",\n       CLIMATE == \"Tropical\") %>% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 15\n     id  year plot  abundance biomass sp    REALM CLIMATE HABITAT PROTECTED_AREA\n  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr> <chr> <chr>   <chr>   <lgl>         \n1    58  1994 Plot…         2       0 Vire… Terr… Tropic… Long t… FALSE         \n2    58  1991 Plot9         1       0 Paru… Terr… Tropic… Long t… FALSE         \n3    58  1994 Plot…         1       0 Neso… Terr… Tropic… Long t… FALSE         \n4    58  1994 Plot6         7       0 Coer… Terr… Tropic… Long t… FALSE         \n5    58  1991 Plot6         9       0 Neso… Terr… Tropic… Long t… FALSE         \n6    58  1994 Plot6         1       0 Marg… Terr… Tropic… Long t… FALSE         \n# ℹ 5 more variables: BIOME_MAP <chr>, TAXA <chr>, ORGANISMS <chr>,\n#   CENT_LAT <dbl>, CENT_LONG <dbl>\n\n\nAlthough those functions are useful to explore big data sets, most of the time, specially when working with multiple variables, filtering each one and examining them separately can be time consuming. For example, let’s say we want to transform our current data frame (merge_df) from long into wide format, as we did before. The first time we transformed our data, we had a single study (id=10) and taxa. Now we have multiple studies and taxa. If we try pivot_wider(), plant and bird species names, for example, will be assigned as columns, making things difficult to disentangle afterwards. An useful way to avoid this is to split our data frame into lists based on each taxa we have. Then, we can apply the function we want for all elements of that list at once. We can do that using the package purrr, which has plenty of functions that make ecologists` life a bit easier in that sense. Let’s try to understand how this package works.\nFirst, let’s create different lists based on different taxa with the split() function:\n\nsplit_taxa <- merge_df %>% \n             split(.$TAXA)\n\nhead(split_taxa)\n\n$All\n# A tibble: 326,527 × 15\n      id  year plot  abundance biomass sp              REALM  CLIMATE HABITAT   \n   <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>

and they are many: i.e. map, map2, map_dfr, map_dfc etc.\n\nmap is used when we want to apply a function to each element of one list (it works like lapply)\nmap2 is used when we want to apply a function to each element of two lists (it works like mapply)\nmap_dfr and map_dfc are used when we want to combine lists into data frames by rows or columns, respectively.\n\nI will use here map and map2 (specially in data viz and statistical modelling post); if you want to know more, take a look at:\nhttps://dcl-prog.stanford.edu/purrr-basics.html\nand\nhttps://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/\nLet’s start with map(), filtering studies that have been sampled over more than 10 years.\n\nfilter_year <- split_taxa %>% map(~ .x %>%\n                                  group_by(id) %>% \n                                  mutate(n_year=n_distinct(year)) %>% # here we create a column showing how many years we have for each taxa, grouped by study id \n                                  filter(n_year > 10)) # and filter only those studies with more than 10 years\n\nIn case you are not used to tidyverse, map() works like lapply() in base R. Tilda(~) represents function(x) and (.) would be (x). Just to show it, in a very non-sense way, let’s sum up the overall number of individuals of each taxa. To make it simple (and even poorer), let’s select only the abundance column first.\n\nselect_abundance <- filter_year %>% \n  map(~ .x %>% ungroup %>% select(abundance))\n\nhead(select_abundance)\n\n$All\n# A tibble: 313,561 × 1\n   abundance\n       <dbl>\n 1         5\n 2         2\n 3        15\n 4        23\n 5        20\n 6        20\n 7        60\n 8        16\n 9         1\n10       150\n# ℹ 313,551 more rows\n\n$Amphibians\n# A tibble: 327 × 1\n   abundance\n       <dbl>\n 1        12\n 2         4\n 3        20\n 4         8\n 5        27\n 6        15\n 7         7\n 8         7\n 9        22\n10        18\n# ℹ 317 more rows\n\n$Benthos\n# A tibble: 1,594,662 × 1\n   abundance\n       <dbl>\n 1        18\n 2        36\n 3         2\n 4      1038\n 5       158\n 6       130\n 7        48\n 8        36\n 9        30\n10         6\n# ℹ 1,594,652 more rows\n\n$Birds\n# A tibble: 1,288,906 × 1\n   abundance\n       <dbl>\n 1       7.5\n 2       8  \n 3      12  \n 4       2.5\n 5       5  \n 6       7  \n 7      11  \n 8       2  \n 9      28  \n10       5  \n# ℹ 1,288,896 more rows\n\n$Fish\n# A tibble: 2,026,702 × 1\n   abundance\n       <dbl>\n 1         7\n 2         5\n 3         2\n 4         1\n 5         1\n 6         6\n 7         6\n 8        52\n 9        16\n10         1\n# ℹ 2,026,692 more rows\n\n$`Freshwater invertebrates`\n# A tibble: 91,528 × 1\n   abundance\n       <dbl>\n 1      2000\n 2     28000\n 3      8000\n 4     19000\n 5     11000\n 6    768000\n 7    156000\n 8     16000\n 9    194000\n10      9000\n# ℹ 91,518 more rows\n\n\nUsing the base R approach, to sum up a column over lists, we would use something like this:\n\nlapply(select_abundance, function(x) { colSums (x)} )\n\n$All\nabundance \n 10525821 \n\n$Amphibians\nabundance \n   115344 \n\n$Benthos\n  abundance \n23503327052 \n\n$Birds\nabundance \n 14673312 \n\n$Fish\nabundance \n 52881387 \n\n$`Freshwater invertebrates`\n abundance \n2898542291 \n\n$`Freshwater plants`\nabundance \n       NA \n\n$Mammals\nabundance \n 679713.1 \n\n$`Marine invertebrates`\nabundance \n256799039 \n\n$`Marine plants`\n  abundance \n25161115487 \n\n$Reptiles\nabundance \n    23555 \n\n$`Terrestrial invertebrates`\nabundance \n  1022759 \n\n$`Terrestrial plants`\nabundance \n  2427471 \n\n\nWith purrr:\n\nselect_abundance %>% \n  map(~ .x %>%  \n       summarise(row_sums = colSums(.)))\n\nor\n\nselect_abundance %>% \n  map(~summarise(., row_sums = colSums(.)))\n\n$All\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  row_sums\n     <dbl>\n1 10525821\n\n$Amphibians\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  row_sums\n     <dbl>\n1   115344\n\n$Benthos\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      row_sums\n         <dbl>\n1 23503327052.\n\n$Birds\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   row_sums\n      <dbl>\n1 14673312.\n\n$Fish\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   row_sums\n      <dbl>\n1 52881387.\n\n$`Freshwater invertebrates`\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n     row_sums\n        <dbl>\n1 2898542291.\n\n$`Freshwater plants`\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  row_sums\n     <dbl>\n1       NA\n\n$Mammals\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  row_sums\n     <dbl>\n1  679713.\n\n$`Marine invertebrates`\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n    row_sums\n       <dbl>\n1 256799039.\n\n$`Marine plants`\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n      row_sums\n         <dbl>\n1 25161115487.\n\n$Reptiles\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  row_sums\n     <dbl>\n1    23555\n\n$`Terrestrial invertebrates`\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  row_sums\n     <dbl>\n1  1022759\n\n$`Terrestrial plants`\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  row_sums\n     <dbl>\n1 2427471.\n\n\nWe filtered our data by n_years > 10, let’s increase this number selecting only studies with more that 30 years of sampling.\n\nbio_list <- split_taxa %>% map(~ .x %>%\n                      group_by(id) %>% \n                      mutate(nyear = n_distinct(year)) %>%\n                      filter(nyear > 30) %>% \n                      select(id:sp,-nyear))\n\nNow we have some elements in our list with 0, meaning that there is no study with more than 30 years for that specific taxa. We can use either discard() or keep() to exclude or keep elements in our list, respectively. Let’s exclude those elements without any data.\n\ndiscard_elements <- bio_list %>% discard(., ~nrow(.) == 0)\n\nNow, instead of 13 taxa we have seven.\nIf you want to exclude elements in a list by name, we can use list_modify(\"listElementName\" = zap()). Note that, previously, we could use list_modify = \"NULL\", but this option is now deprecated. For example, let’s exclude “Benthos” from our object\n\nno_benthos <- discard_elements %>% \n  list_modify(\"Benthos\" = zap())\n\nLet’s create a more complex object now. As we have both abundance and biomass column, let’s create a new column representing presence/absence (pres_ab). First, though, we have to deal with the NA’s in our data. We can use replace_na() for that.\n\npresence_abs <- no_benthos %>% \n  map(~ .x %>%\n                      mutate(i = row_number()) %>% \n                      group_by(id) %>% \n                      replace_na(list(abundance = 0, biomass = 0)) %>% \n                      mutate(pres_ab = abundance+biomass,\n                             pres_ab = case_when(pres_ab > 0 ~ 1,\n                                   T ~ 0)))\n\nHere I introduced a new (very useful) function case_when(). In the current example, I created the “pres_ab” column and asked the function to assign 1 (presence) case when the sum of abundance+biomass is higher than 0 and assign 0 when the opposite is true (T ~ 0) . You can use case_when() in many different ways, being very useful when we have to create new columns based on other columns or change values within columns.\nAs in the long format we don’t have species assigned with 0 either in abundance or biomass, “pres_ab” column will be always 1 (my bad haha). Let’s transform the data into the wide format to get presences and absences indeed. If we were not working with lists, we should transform each taxa separately. We can now combine purrr with pivot_wider() and transform all elements of our list.\n\nwide_list <- presence_abs %>% \n  map(~ .x %>%\n        group_by(id,year,sp) %>% \n        select(-plot,-abundance, -biomass) %>%\n        summarise(pres_ab = sum(pres_ab)) %>%\n        mutate(pres_ab = case_when(pres_ab > 0 ~ 1,\n                                   T ~ 0))%>% \n        ungroup %>% \n        arrange(sp) %>% # sp names in alphabetic order\n        pivot_wider(names_from = \"sp\", values_from = \"pres_ab\", \n                    values_fill = list(pres_ab=0)))\n\nNow we have 0’s and 1’s. As we have species presences absences per year, we can check species gains and losses. For that we transform our data back into the long format (now with 0’s and 1’s) and use case_when() again to create the new column\nAs we are working with temporal data, we can use case_when() combined with lag() or lead() to analyse either the previous or next row in our data set, respectively. For example, let’s create a new column to check species gains and losses per year.\nNow I will transform the lists into the long format again and check species gains and losses using case_when().\n\nlong_list <-wide_list %>% \n  map(~.x %>% \n        pivot_longer(-c(id,year),names_to = \"sp\", values_to = \"pres_ab\"))\n\nNow we can check how each species is changing over time\n\ngain_loss <- long_list %>% \n  map(~.x %>% \n        group_by(id,sp) %>% \n        arrange(year, .by_group = TRUE)%>%\n    mutate(gain_loss = case_when(row_number() == 1 ~ \"NA\",\n                                 lag(pres_ab == 0) & pres_ab == 1  ~ \"gain\", \n                                 lag(pres_ab == 1) & pres_ab == 0 ~ \"loss\",\n                                 lag(pres_ab == 0) & pres_ab == 0  ~ \"persist_ab\",\n                         T ~ \"persist_pres\")))\n\nHere I first grouped the data by study id and species, then I ordered the year, separately, by group. With mutate(), I created the column gain_loss, putting NA to the first year of each study, since we cant have gains or losses at the first year. Further, I assigned gain when the species was absent at the previous year (lag(pres_ab==0)) and present in the next one (pres_ab==1) and the opposite to loss. Also, if the species persisted absent or present, but we could also use “NA” if the idea is to check only gains and losses.\nAnother nice trick, when dealing with lists, is that sometimes we need to use the name of the elements in a list as a column. For example, here the name of the elements in our list is the taxa’s name. We can use imap and mutate to create a new column based on these names. With mutate (in dplyr 1.0.0) we can also select the position of the new column with .before and .after, otherwise the new column will be the last one.\n\ntaxa_list <- gain_loss %>% imap(., ~mutate(.x, TAXA = .y, .after = year))\n\n\n\nSome other tricks with purrr\nSometimes, we have to deal with nested lists. I will not focus on nested lists here, but just out of curiosity, let’s split our list once more, now based on the different studies we have. So we will have lists based on taxa and nested based on studies.\n\nnest_list <- wide_list %>% \n  map(~split(.,.$id))\n\nUsually, when I have such kind of data, I use nested maps - not sure if this is the most elegant approach though. For example, let’s say we want to check the species richness for each taxa in each study based on years of sampling. I’d do something like this:\n\ndouble_map <- nest_list %>% map(map, ~mutate(.,richness = rowSums(.[-1:-2]), .after = year))\n\nTo work with two lists, we can use map2() . A simple example:\n\nlist1<- as.list(c(a = 1, b = 2 ,c = 3))\n\nlist2<- as.list(c(a = 1, b = 2 ,c = 3))\n\nmap2(list1, list2, sum)\n\n$a\n[1] 2\n\n$b\n[1] 4\n\n$c\n[1] 6\n\n\nI will use more map2() in the following posts, but this is particular interesting for those working with functional diversity of multiple taxa. You can do the same we did here (split the data by taxa), in both community and trait data, and then use map2() to calculate functional diversity. It will not work here of course, but something like this might work for you:\n\nlibrary(FD)\nt1 <- map2(list_trait, list_comm, dbFD) # list with traits, list with communities and the function you want to apply (in this case, dbFD)\n\nand then you can get the CWM, Rao or whatever metric you want from the dbFD() function\n\nlist_CWM <- t1 %>% map(\"CWM\")\n\nlist_RaoQ <- t1 %>% map(\"RaoQ\") %>% \n  map(~ .x %>% as.data.frame())\n\nAnother important trick we can do with purrr is to load multiple data into R. Sometimes we download ecological data and the .csv files come separated into multiple zip files. If you have faced that, and had to extract each file one by one, guess what? You can run them all at once with purrr:\n\nmanyfiles <- list.files(here(\"data\"), pattern = \"*.csv\", full.names = T) %>%\n        map_df(~vroom(.)) #here(\"data\"), as I explained at the beginning of this post, is where your files are located in your Rproject\n\nIn summary, tidyverse has many functions that can boost our data analysis and how / when to use them will depend on your data and what you want to get from it. I hope to have kicked off some new useful functions and tricks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Mountains provide a timely opportunity to examine the potential effects of climate change on biodiversity. However, nature conservation in mountain areas have mostly focused on the observed part of biodiversity, not revealing the suitable but absent species—dark diversity. Dark diversity allows calculating the community completeness, indicating whether sites should be restored (low completeness) or conserved (high completeness). Functional traits can be added, showing what groups should be focused on. Here we assessed changes in taxonomic and functional observed and dark diversity of epiphytic lichens along elevational transects in Northern Italy spruce forests. Eight transects (900–1900 m) were selected, resulting in 48 plots and 240 trees, in which lichens were sampled using four quadrats per tree (10 × 50 cm). Dark diversity was estimated based on species co-occurrence (Beals index). We considered functional traits related to growth form, photobiont type and reproductive strategy. Linear and Dirichlet regressions were used to examine changes in taxonomic metrics and functional traits along gradient. Our results showed that all taxonomic metrics increased with elevation and functional traits of lichens differed between observed and dark diversity. At low elevations, due to low completeness and harsh conditions, both restoration and conservation activities are needed, focusing on crustose species. Towards high elevations, conservation is more important to prevent species pool losses, focusing on macrolichens, lichens with Trentepohlia and sexual reproduction. Finally, dark diversity and functional traits provide a novel tool to enhance nature conservation, indicating particular threatened groups, creating windows of opportunities to protect species from both local and regional extinctions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Understanding biodiversity changes in the Anthropocene (e.g. due to climate and land‐use change) is an urgent ecological issue. This important task is challenging because global change effects and species responses are dependent on the spatial scales considered. Furthermore, responses are often not immediate. However, both scale and time delay issues can be tackled when, at each study site, we consider dynamics in both observed and dark diversity. Dark diversity includes those species in the region that can potentially establish and thrive in the local sites’ conditions but are currently locally absent. Effectively, dark diversity connects biodiversity at the study site to the regional scales and defines the site‐specific species pool (observed and dark diversity together). With dark diversity, it is possible to decompose species gains and losses into two space‐related components: one associated with local dynamics (species moving from observed to dark diversity and vice versa) and another related to gains and losses of site‐specific species pool (species moving to and from the pool after regional immigration, regional extinction or change in local ecological conditions). Extinction debt and immigration credit are useful to understand dynamics in observed diversity, but delays might happen in species pool changes as well. In this opinion piece we suggest that considering both observed and dark diversity and their temporal dynamics provides a deeper understanding of biodiversity changes. Considering both observed and dark diversity creates opportunities to improve conservation by allowing to identify species that are likely to go regionally extinct as well as foreseeing which of the species that newly arrive to the region are more likely to colonize local sites. Finally, by considering temporal lags and species gains and losses in observed and dark diversity, we combine phenomena at both spatial and temporal scales, providing a novel tool to examine biodiversity change in the Anthropocene."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Locally abundant species are typically widespread, while locally scarce species are geographically restricted—the so-called abundance-occupancy relationships (AORs). AORs help explain the drivers of species rarity and community assembly, but little is known about how variation around such relationship is driven by species traits and niche-based processes, particularly in tropical woody plants. We tested the hypothesis that AORs in tropical dryland woody plants are positive and mediated by niche and functional traits along environmental gradients.\n\n\n\nThe Caatinga dry forest and Cerrado savannah, Brazil.\n\n\n\nWe aggregated abundance and occurrence data into grid-cells representing local (10-km) to landscape scales (50-km). We calculated species mean relative abundance at occupied grid-cells (local abundance) and the proportion of grid-cells occupied (occupancy), and estimated their niche breadth and marginality along multivariate environmental gradients.\n\n\n\nAORs were positive but weak at different scales in both regions due to some locally abundant but geographically restricted species, with most species being both locally and geographically rare. Cross-species variation in local abundance was largely unpredictable, but occupancy was strongly driven by niche and functional traits, with a prominent negative effect of niche marginality. Geographically restricted species were associated with rare habitats, such as wetter and less intensively used habitats. Large seeds and abiotic dispersal favoured occupancy in Caatinga at small and large spatial scales, respectively, whereas species with conservative leaves were more widespread across scales in Cerrado.\n\n\n\nWoody plants in dry tropical biotas exhibit weak AORs, a pattern likely related to low habitat availability and dispersal limitation. Caatinga and Cerrado biotas emerge as environmentally structured at multiple spatial scales, with several habitat-specialist rare species bearing specific regenerative and resource-use traits and relying on conditions threatened by climate change and land-use intensification. Examining AORs through the lens of niche, functional traits and spatial scales enables mapping patterns and drivers of species commonness and rarity, enhancing understanding of species assembly and providing tools for biodiversity conservation."

    "text": "Ecological communities are assembled by regional and local processes. These processes select species through their traits, which are tied to species’ evolutionary history. A multifaceted approach, encompassing taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity can thus help us to better understand community assembly. We asked what the relative importance of geography, climate and soil parameters is in driving taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities at local (alpha) and larger scales (beta diversity).\n\n\n\nAtlantic Europe.\n\n\n\nPlant communities of Violion caninae grasslands.\n\n\n\nAlpha and beta taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities were calculated for 153 sites. Traits were obtained from the LEDA database and phylogeny from Daphne. We summarized climatic (CHELSA database) and soil variables using principal component analysis (PCA), and geographical distance using Moran’s Eigenvector Maps (MEMs). To assess the importance of environment and space on all three facets, we performed redundancy and distance-based redundancy analyses for alpha and beta diversity, respectively, using the PCA and MEM axes as predictors.\n\n\n\nCompared to alpha diversity, beta diversity was relatively high in taxonomic diversity, but very low in functional and phylogenetic diversity. Geography and climate were relatively more important at larger scales, whereas soil conditions acted more strongly at the local scales, with alpha diversity of all facets decreasing towards richer and acidic soils.\n\n\n\nConsidering multiple biodiversity facets along environmental and spatial gradients enables advancing both theoretical and applied aspects of community assembly. Accordingly, the observed turnover across the study area was mediated by species that share similar suites of traits and evolutionary history. Towards richer and acidic soils, exclusion of weaker competitors was an important filter at local scales. In summary, assessing multiple biodiversity facets and broad scale environmental gradients is key to understand the relative importance of multi-scale processes driving the community assembly of European grasslands."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Global change drivers (e.g. climate and land use) affect the species and functional traits observed in a local site but also its dark diversity—the set of species and traits locally suitable but absent. Dark diversity links regional and local scales and, over time, reveals taxa under expansion lags by depicting the potential biodiversity that remains suitable but is absent locally. Since global change effects on biodiversity are both spatially and temporally scale dependent, examining long-term temporal dynamics in observed and dark diversity would be relevant to assessing and foreseeing biodiversity change. Here, we used sedimentary pollen data to examine how both taxonomic and functional observed and dark diversity changed over the past 14 500 years in northern Europe. We found that taxonomic and functional observed and dark diversity increased over time, especially after the Late Glacial and during the Late Holocene. However, dark diversity dynamics revealed expansion lags related to species’ functional characteristics (dispersal limitation and stress intolerance) and an extensive functional redundancy when compared to taxa in observed diversity. We highlight that assessing observed and dark diversity dynamics is a promising tool to examine biodiversity change across spatial scales, its possible causes, and functional consequences."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Community assembly in regenerating forests is a key topic in ecology. Most studies examine the assembly process assessing adult individuals along the forest succession. Although the adult stage is the final outcome of the assembly process, both abiotic and biotic filters can affect community assembly during early ontogenetic stages. Here we investigate whether the functional composition and trait assembly patterns (trait convergence or divergence) change across ontogenetic stages along regenerating forest stands exposed to precipitation and chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) gradients. Location: Caatinga dry forest, Catimbau National Park, Pernambuco, Brazil. Methods: Seeds (rain and bank), seedlings and adults of woody plant species were recorded across 15 forest regenerating stands (4‐70 years since land abandonment) via 0.1‐ha, exposed to precipitation and CAD gradients. Seven functional traits related to species dispersal, establishment and resource use were measured for adult individuals and used to calculate the trait values for seeds and seedlings. 20 old‐growth forest stands were used as a regional flora. Results: Functional composition (CWM) varied across ontogenetic stages as wood density increased from seeds to seedlings, while seed mass increased from seeds to both seedlings and adults. CWM also varied along precipitation/disturbance gradients but not along forest regeneration regardless the ontogenetic stage. Among seeds, dispersal distance increased towards wetter forest stands and decreased towards disturbed sites, while adult wood density increased from drier to wetter regenerating forest stands. Traits converged along the precipitation gradient but not in response to time since land abandonment. Conclusions: Caatinga dry forest regeneration is functionally structured across ontogenetic stages mediated mostly by water availability, but not over time since land abandonment. The effect of water availability on forest regeneration across ontogenetic stages highlights the complexity of species assembly in human modified landscapes, imposing important consequences considering the expected increasing aridity in the Caatinga."

    "text": "Land-use changes have contributed to an increased interest in understanding the drivers of forest regeneration in human-modified landscapes. This is particularly true for arid ecosystems, in which regeneration is relatively less known, but more sensitive to land-use intensification and climate change. This paper aims to identify the relative contribution of seed rain and soil seed banks for the regeneration of the Caatinga dry forest in northeastern Brazil as well as their drivers. We monitored seed rain and soil seed bank of woody plant species during a 14-month period across 15 regenerating (4–70 yr old) and 5 old-growth forest stands. Stand age, precipitation, chronic anthropogenic disturbance, and forest aboveground biomass were our explanatory variables. A total of 5081 seeds from 61 species were recorded in the seed rain across all forest stands (1.81 intact seeds per m2 per month). Regenerating and old-growth stands did not differ relative to average seed rain scores, with the proportion of zoochoric seeds positively associated with forest biomass. In the seed bank, we recorded a total of 5660 seeds from 64 species (5.05 intact seeds per m2 per month), with no differences among stands, except for species richness; with mean seed size positively associated with stand age. Collectively, seed rain and seed bank captured only 40% of the woody regional flora, mostly dry-fruited species (70% of all species). Moreover, assemblages were dominated by a few hyper-abundant species. Our results suggest that the Caatinga dry forest supports relatively low-density and impoverished seed rain and soil seed bank. Additionally, seed rain and soil seed bank do not exhibit directional changes through forest regeneration for most of the attributes, and deviate little from the scores of old-growth forest stands. Compared to resprouting, they may pose limited influence on woody plant recruitment and dry forest regeneration across human-modified landscapes. In this context, Caatinga restoration approaches based on natural seed rain and soil seed banks may be of limited effectiveness."
