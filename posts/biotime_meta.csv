West Thornton. Grafton County. New Hampshire. USA. Our study took place on the 10-ha forest plot de- scribed by Holmes and Sturges (1975). which is located on a relatively steep (20-25%). south-southeast facing slope at an elevation of 500 to 600 m and adjacent to the lower third of watershed 6. the reference area for many of the Hubbard Brook ecosystem studies. The study plot was situated within a large tract of unfrag- mented and relatively homogeneous northern hard- woods forest. > 5 km distant from. and at an elevation 300 m above. the nearest human settlement. The only human-caused disturbances near the study area were on three experimental watersheds. 13. 10. and 22 ha in extent. which were logged by clear-cutting in 1967. in 1970. and from 1973 to 1975. respectively. The nearest of these was 0.6 km from the edge of our plot. the others were 1 and 2 km away. Although some for- est-dwelling birds moved to these areas in mid and late summer to feed on ripening fruit. we have no evidence that birds settling and breeding on the study area were in any way affected by these logged areas.Bird populations Bird censuses were conducted in a consistent manner in each of the 16 summers. These census methods have been described in detail by Holmes and Sturges (1975). Briefly. they involved: (1) Timed censuses. Two ob- servers moved at a rate of 50 m/6 min along parallel transect lines. 1 00 m apart. and recorded all birds heard or seen within 50 m on either side of the line. Since the 10-ha plot was 500 m long and 200 m wide and these lines ran 50 m in from the long sides. the entire plot was surveyed in a 1-h census. From these records. the numbers of individuals observed on the plot were then tallied. A minimum of two such censuses was conducted each week from late May through mid-July. (2) Territory-mapping. The positions of individual males (and females when seen). especially those en- gaged in simultaneous singing with neighbors. were plotted on a gridded census map. From these records. the territories of the males of many species could be delineated. (3) Mist-net captures. Forty to 50 mist nets. located at 50-m intervals on the census grid. were op- erated for 6-8 h/d. usually 1 or 2 d/wk from late May through early July in all years except 1980. Each cap- tured bird was given an aluminum band plus a unique combination of colored plastic bands. Capture and re- capture frequencies provided additional information on the presence of birds on the plot. including females and occasionally floaters. (4) Detailed observations. These provided information on nesting events and on the occurrence of females associated with males. Data from all methods were pooled and used to es- timate the total numbers of adult birds of each species living on the 1 0-ha study area during the breeding pe- riod. late May to early July. Final density estimates were adjusted for territories occurring only partly on the plot (i.e.. if a territory of a mated pair was half off the study area. only 0.5 male and 0.5 female for a total of one bird was counted) and for unmated males. The data therefore represent the total numbers of adult in- dividuals occupying 10 ha of northern hardwoods. For comparisons with most other studies. the numbers of individuals estimated to be on our plot should be di- vided in half to approximate the numbers of breeding pairs. These methods were most efficient for estimating the numbers of relatively small. mostly passerine birds that inhabit these forests. but also most woodpeckers and the one hummingbird species (see Table 2).

The abundances of all mobile taxa of fishes (Scarids. Labrids. Acanthurids. Serranids. etc.) observed on on a five by fifty meter transect which extends from the bottom to the surface of the water column are recorded by a diver using SCUBA. The diver then swims back along a one by fifty meter section of the original transect line and records the abundances of all non-mobile or cryptic taxa of fishes (Pomacentids. Gobiids. Cirrhitids. Holocentrids etc). Surveys are conducted between 0900 and 1600 hours (Moorea local time) during late July or early August each year. In 2006. divers also began to estimate the size (length) of each fish observed to the nearest half cm. Four replicate transects are surveyed in each of six locations on the forereef (two on each of Moorea's three sides). six locations on the backreef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) and on six locations on the fringing reef (two on each of Moorea's three sides) for a total of 72 individual transects. Transects are permanently marked using a series of small. stainless steel posts affixed to the reef. Transects on the forereef are located at a depth of approximately 15m. those on the backreef are located at a depth of approximately 1.5m and those on the fringing reef are located at a depth of approximately 10m.LocationsAnnual fish census locations are labeled with four components in a stratified design: 6 sites. 3 habitats. 4 transects. 2 swaths. (The swaths are the transect widths of 1 m and 5 m.) Therefore there are 144 unique locations surveyed each year. The six MCR-LTER sites span the three shores of the roughly triangular island of Moorea with Sites 1 and 2 on the north-facing shore. Sites 3 and 4 on the south-east-facing shore. and Sites 5 and 6 on the south-west-facing shore. At each site. the three habitats are the Fringing Reef. Backreef. and Forereef. At each habitat. there are four transects. Each transect has two swaths. The two swaths are described in the Diver Observation method step.Dive ConditionsIn addition to the biotic data collected. divers also record data on the date and time each transect was surveyed. wind speed and sea state. swell height in m. amount of cloud cover in % and horizontal visibility in m. Dive conditions are recorded for each dive. which is unique to a habitat at a site for a year. Therefore there are 18 unique dive conditions each year (3 habitats at 6 sites).DiversAt each site. at each habitat. there are four transects. each covered by an assigned diver (in 2005 by 2 divers). Whenever possible. the same diver covers the same transect number every year. (Transect 3 has varied.) The diver is listed by their initials. (In 2005. the initials of 2 divers are concatenated.) The diver ID is determined by the year and transect number,,NA,,,,,

Lockley. He took a lease on the island in October1927. and kept records of breeding birds from 1928 to1940 (Lockley 1938. 1947). After the war theobservatory was run by the West Wales Field Societyand the Council for the Promotion of Field Studies (nowthe Field Studies Council). and later by the EdwardGrey Institute of Field Ornithology of the University ofOxford. Records of breeding and. for most species inmost years. counts or estimates of the numbers ofbreeding pairs are available from 1928 to 1979. with abreak from 1941 to 1945. making 47 years of records.Those up to 1967 have been published by Lack (1969)and analysed by Williamson (1981). Those since 1967have been extracted from the Annual Reports of theObservatory in the Alexander Library of the EdwardGrey Institute. The whole record for land and waterbirds is given in Tab. 1.The criterion for inclusion in Tab. 1 is breeding. butas is now well recognised. there are different degrees ofcertainty in such records. For a study of immigrationand extinction the important question is whether a pairof birds was attempting to breed. rather than whether itbred successfully. For instance the raven Corvus coraxhad one pair every year (two in 1961). but in 1978built a nest in Steep Bay. but it remained empty. Inthe British Trust for Ornithology code this is B. Nestbuilding. and counts only as Probable breeding in thisspecies. though it is regarded as Confirmed breedingin most others (Sharrock 1976). For this study it countsas a population of one pair. In most cases the annualreport gives a single figure for the number of pairs. Forneighbouring integers. e.g. 12 or 13. I have taken thehigher figure. for ranges. e.g. 35 to 40. a figure at or just slightly from Lack (1969). and includes figures thatabove the mid-point (38 in this case). Lack records as question marks. and Lockley also givesFor the pre-war figures Lockley (1947) differs the figures for 1940. I have therefore taken histhroughout. rather than Lack's. The only importantdifference in relation to the MacArthur-Wilson theoryis that Lockley records one pair of sky lark Alauda arvensisin 1938. which Lack (and Williamson 1981) recordas an extinction followed by an immigration in1939. Lockley also notes that he shot or deported littleowls Athene noctua when he could. because they atestorm petrels Hydrobates pelagicus. so I have excludedlittle owls from Tab. 1.It is evident that many of the estimates of the commonbirds in Tab. 1 are round figures. In some yearsestimates are lacking. though breeding is recorded. andas a full set of figures is needed for the calculations thatfollow I have interpolated. approximately linearly. insuch cases. The interpolated figures are in italics in Tab.1.Skokholm is a most important station for sea-birdpopulations. Throughout the years there have beenthousands of pairs of Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus.storm petrel Hydrobates pelagicus. and puffinsFratercula arctica. and these are the largest colonies.along with those on the neighbouring island of Skomer.in the Celtic Sea (Cramp et al. 1974). Herring gullsLarus argentatus and lesser black-backed gulls Larusfuscus have increased from hundreds of pairs pre-war tothousands now. There are also hundreds of pairs ofrazorbills Alca torda and guillemots Uria aalge. Thegreat black-backed gull Larus marinus population iscontrolled at around ten pairs. The fulmar Fulmarusglacialis first bred in 1967 and even now occupies lessthan twenty sites. There have been casual records ofbreeding of shag Phalacrocorax aristotelis and kittiwakeRissa tridactyla (Lockley 1969). There have also beenthirty to forty pairs of rock pipits Anthus spinolettabreeding on the cliffs each year. Lack (1969) did notregard them as land-birds. and I have. somewhat reluctantly.followed him. partly because the estimates ofpopulation size are even rougher than those of themeadow pipit A. pratensis.MethodsMany features of the data can be brought out by simplemethods (Williamson 1981). However. to produce asatisfactory ordination of both species and years is notso simple. and requires a consideration both of differentordination methods. and of whether the data should betransformed.For most biological populations a transformation tothe logarithm of the numbers is desirable (Williamson1972a). When there are many zeros. as in Tab. 1. log(n+1) or better the arc-sinh transformation. which islog (n+(n2+ 1)12). can be used (Williamson 1981). butthese small numbers show features of a Poisson distribution.s o a square root transformation may be desirable(Pollard 1977). Tukey (1977) gives methods fordetermining an appropriate power transformation.which he refers to as re-expression. (with the logarithmbeing equivalent to a zero power). It is well-known thata plot of the logarithm of the mean against thelogarithm of the variance may indicate that a transformation is needed. When the variance is proportional tothe mean. a square root transformation is indicated,,NA,,,,,

Site descriptionWithin the 20 ha study area there are 24 experimental plots. Each plot has anarea of 0.25 ha and is fenced to regulate rodent access to the plot. Access is regulated using gatescut into the fencing. Large gates (3.7 ? 5.7 cm) allow all small mammals to access plots. Smallgates (1.9 ? 1.9 cm) exclude kangaroo rats (Dipodomys) whose inflated auditory bullae make theirskulls too large to pass through the gates. Rodent removal plots do not contain any gates andanimals caught on those plots are removed and released outside the cattle exclosure fence.On each plot there are 49 permanent trapping stations marked by rebar stakes forming a 7 ? 7 grid.Every stake on a plot has a unique identifying number denoting the coordinate of that stake on thatplot. For example. stake 11 is the first stake on the first row. Rows are numbered 1 through 7going from the most northern row to the most southern. Columns are numbered 1 through 7 goingfrom the most western column to the most eastern (See metadata.htm. Fig. 1).Treatments: See metadata.htm. Table 1. for details on treatment assignments for each plot.Data Collection Period. Frequency: From 1977?2002. plots were trapped around each newmoon ? which occurs approximately once a month. though occasionally blue moons do occur.resulting in 2 separate surveys in a month. Occasionally. months are missed. Months that areentirely missed are not noted in the database. Sometimes weather or other unforeseen occurrencesprevent the complete trapping of a survey. these are noted in the database (see Table 1 below).3. Research MethodsField: The site is surveyed for rodents approximately once each month. The survey occurs asclose to the new moon as possible to minimize external effects on trapping success which could bemisconstrued as actual changes in populations. During a survey. each plot is trapped for one nightwith treatments divided evenly between nights to eliminate differences between controls andtreatments caused by environmental differences on different nights. When a plot is surveyed. allgates are closed to ensure that only resident individuals are captured. At each stake. one Shermanlive-trap is placed and baited with millet seed. Traps are collected the next morning andindividuals processed. Each individual was tagged and data on species. location caught (plot andstake). sex. reproductive condition. weight. and hindfoot length were recorded. Until 1993.individuals were tagged using either ear tags or toe tags. After 1993. individuals werepredominately tagged using Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tags. Use of PIT tags wasE090-118-D1-Rodent metadata http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/Portal_rodent_meta...halted from 1997?2000 while we waited for a patent infringement lawsuit to be resolved againstthe company that supplied our tags and scanning system (Troyvan). In 2000 we resumed using PITtags. using a different system (Biomark). It is noted in the database if either an animal escapedbefore all information was gathered. was removed from the site because it was caught on a plot itwas supposed to be excluded from. or died during trapping.Most data has been consistently collected over the timespan of the study. The one exception is thatinitially data were also collected on the location of the burrow for Dipodomys spectabilis andNeotoma albigula. This was discontinued after 1994.Taxonomy and systematics: Taxonomy and identification of species is consistent with Mammalsof Arizona by Hoffmeister (1986). with the exception that some species identified as Perognathusin Hoffmeister (1986) are now a separate genus (Chaetodipus).

These cruises generally take place in May. at thepeak spawning period and covering the spawning area of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay.The objective of the cruises is to evaluate anchovy biomass using the DEPM method. Asynthesis of the anchovy spawning areas. larvae and juvenile distribution. and hypothesesabout recruitment mechanisms can be found in Irigoien et al (2007). Stations were locatedevery 3 nautical miles (nm) along transects 15 nm apart perpendicular to the coast. Avertical plankton haul was made at each sampling station. using a 150?m PairoVET net (2-CalVET nets. Smith et al.. 1985). The net was lowered to a maximum depth of 100 m or 5m above the bottom at shallower stations. Samples were preserved in 4% formaldehydebuffered with sodium tetraborate. Samples were stored in 150 ml jars. The sample wasthoroughly mixed in a measuring cylinder. the total volume measured (usually around 150ml) and an aliquot of 6 ml was taken with a pipette from each sample. The average numberof organisms counted in each plate with this sub sampling set up is around 400 individuals.The aliquot was stained for 24 hours with 4 ml 1% eosin. which stains the cell cytoplasmand the muscle protein. This stain creates sufficient contrast to be recognised by imageanalysis and reduces counting of detrital material. The sub-samples were scanned onpolystyrene plates (12.7 x 8.5 cm) in 24 bit colour. at a resolution of 600 dpi using an HPScanjet8200 series scanner (reflective). The samples were not manually separated.Preliminary work (unpublished) has shown that as long as the percentage of the imagecovered by the sample remains below 3 % there is a linear relation between the number ofitems and the automatic counting. Over that threshold the percentage of organisms touchingeach other increases and results in an underestimation of the abundance. For samples fromthe Bay of Biscay the aliquot taken and the plastic plate size assures that this limit is notreached. These images were analyzed using Zooimage (www.sciviews.org/zooimage). Atotal of 17 classes were selected combining expert opinion and the class selection methodproposed by Fernandes et al. (2008). Classification was carried out using a Random Forestalgorithm which provided the best results with an estimated accuracy 88.23% using 10 foldcross-validation. Accuracy for each of the classes and the confusion matrix are provided inTables 2 and 3. The spatial distribution of the classes that were rare and resulted in poorclassification is not presented.

In some instances a substrate sample was taken from onehalf of one grab sample and the remaining portion was discarded.leaving only one half of the grab t o be combined with the other grabsamples from the station.Only adequate grab samples were retained. An adequate sampleis one in which the grab samples the bottom evenly. samples atleast 2 liters of substrate. and is closed when brought to the surface.Depth of penetratlon into the substrate may vary with type of substrate.but at most stations depth of penetration was from 6 to 10 cm.After the collection of a set of grabs from a station. substrateand organisms were washed on a stainless steel screen with a mesh sizeof 0.5 mm. Retained invertebrates and debris were preserved in formalin(1 part formaldehyde with 9 parts water) for transporting to the ArcticBiological Station where they were processed.Processing consists of sorting. identifying. counting and weighingspecimens in each sample.Each sample was sorted by hand using a Wild M5 dissectingmicroscope. Specimens were identified to species in most cases andcounts of specimens for each species were recorded. Speciesidentification was not attempted for a few taxa. such as nematodes.nemerteans. hydroids . and bryozoans. and although several species maybe involved. they were listed by taxon on a collective basis.

The dry weight excludes tubes and shells. butno effort was made to eliminate gut contents. The calcareous partsof echinoderms and the skeletal parts of sponges are included in thedry weight because of difficulty in separating organic and inorganicparts.Data are presented on a m2 basis (Tables 8-108).

The MNCR was initiated to provide a comprehensive baseline of information on marine habitats and their associated species around the coast of Britain which would aid coastal zone and sea-use management and to contribute to the identification of areas of marine natural heritage importance. The focus of MNCR work was on benthic habitats (often referred to as biotopes) in intertidal and inshore (typically within 3nm) subtidal areas.The majority of data were collected using methods described in the MNCR Rationale and Methods report (Hiscock 1996).

POP procedure is to count any haul that is interrupted intentionally to allow the gear to soak longer. or that is interrupted for weather or mechanical problems for longer than 6 hours. as a ?split haul? (i.e. a single set that has two or more hauls associated with it). Further. during the 2001 NED experimental fishery each set was divided into 2 hauls. This accounts for the discrepancy between numbers of sets and numbers of hauls.Of the trips monitored. a total of 206 vessels were observed at least once during this time period. Data from 4 trips were excluded from analysis in this report because the gear was set as bottom longline and directed at shark species.Although a wide variety of fish were caught by the observed longline vessels. only about six species were routinely valued by the fishery as a marketable product.

The summer RV survey follows a stratified random sampling design (Halliday and Kohler 1971). and includes both hydrographic sampling and sampling of fish and invertebrates using a bottom otter trawl.The bottom trawl survey was originally planned to provide biomass and abundance trends for groundfish residing at depths from about 50 m to 400 m. and was extended to cover depths down to 750 m in 1999.There were changes to the net used and the vessel conducting the survey in 1982 and 1983. From 1970 ? 1981 the RV A.T. Cameron. a side-trawler using the Yankee 36 trawl. was used for the survey. In 1982. the RV Lady Hammond was used. towing a Western IIA trawl. Since 1983. the Alfred Needler has been the primary survey vessel. and the Western IIA trawl has been used in all years. Conversion factors were calculated for net and vessel changes (Fanning 1985).For long-term averages. the most appropriate starting point has been selected for each species. In the case of white hake. biomass plots start in 1970 but the abundance index data only go back to 1982. For silver hake. biomass plots and abundance index data are used starting in 1982. This is in conjunction with the change in the type of trawl. from a Yankee 36 to a Western IIA. as well as more consistent identification of white hake and red hake.In 2010. additional survey tows were completed in deeper water off the shelf edge (750 ? 1.800 m) to investigate species composition and biomass in deeper waters. Catches from these stations are not included in the biomass index estimates. to ensure that comparability with other years is maintained. Distribution plots are included here only for the most abundant species noted at these depths. Tables of the entire catches at these depths are also presented.The survey area has been divided into three zones. based on oceanography and biogeography.

Working at depths of 3 to 16 m with teams using other existing rapid assessment methods. a method for algal assessment is needed that will minimize the time in the water yet yield the greatest amount of data possible. A high-resolution digital camera mounted on a 0.18 m? photo quadrat frame (Fig.1) with an Ikelite Substrobe digital slave strobe has been built to quantitatively assess marine algae.In addition to photographs. data from each quadrat are recorded on a waterproof data sheet that includes space for recording the species found in the quadrat. a ?map? area for identifying cryptic species in depressions that may prove difficult in computer analysis. and codes for the most common genera and species of macroalgae. corals. invertebrates. and substrate types to standardize and shorten note taking.Two trained observers move along the transect together with one observer placing the framer and operating the camera and the other taking notes. (Fig.2). Photographs are taken at predetermined random points.After a photograph is taken by the first diver. the second diver identifies algae within the photoquadrat. records the relative abundance of the 5 most abundant algae on a scale of 1 ? 5 (with 1 being most abundant). draws a quadrat map locating species that may be hard to identify in a photograph. and collects representative samples of the algal species in the quadrats for later identification in the laboratory.Once data are recorded. the photoquadrat is moved to the next random point and the procedure repeated. To prevent redundancy. only samples of new algal species found in subsequent quadrats are collected.

NOAA-certified CRED divers conduct towed diver surveys as a method of assessing relatively large areas of reef habitat. This method involves towing two divers behind a small surface craft that is moving at a velocity of 1-2 mph. Although the driver of the surface craft attempts to follow a depth contour. the divers also actively maneuver the ?towboards? they are holding onto so as to maintain a relatively constant elevation above the surface of the reef.    One of the two towboards is equipped with a digital videocamera that is pointing in the forward-looking direction so as to document both the ?rugosity ?. or 3-dimensional topography. of the reef. as well as the fish associated with the reef. The other towboard is equipped with a digital videocamera that is pointing in the downward-looking direction. so as to record the benthos over which the diver and camera are moving.    Divers maneuvering the towboards on which the cameras are mounted record selected data pertaining to fish and to habitat. using datasheets mounted on the towboards. These in-situ observations are used to assist with preliminary summaries of the fish communities and the reef habitat. and as a general reference during more detailed. computer-assisted analyses.    Both towboards are equipped with a SEABIRD sensor that records depth and water temperature every 5 seconds. so that biotic observations can be linked to salient physical parameters.    A GPS unit on the surface tow vessel records the trackline over which the divers. and recording cameras. are being towed. so that the results that are later generated by analysis of the digital videos can be linked to geographic position.    A complete towboard survey is 50 minutes in length. and covers close to 2 miles of reef.Analysis of Towboard Benthic VideotapesUsing computer-assisted technology. the images captured by the downward-pointed camera of the benthic habitat are quantified as percent cover of the principle components that can be recognized from the videotapes. These components include: live coral. unencrusted (recently dead) coral. macroalgae. turf algae. coralline algae. other invertebrates. sand. rock. pavement. and rubble.The suite of corals that can be identified from the videotapes depends upon the assemblage of corals present in the area being surveyed (e.g.. the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands are less speciose than the U.S. Line & Phoenix Islands). and in general is limited to the genus level of identification. Similarly. algae can typically be identified from the videotapes only according to their functional class (macro. turf. coralline).Thus. while towed diver surveys are capable of assessing large areas of reef. it requires more stationary divers working at smaller spatial scales during REA surveys to achieve a higher degree of taxonomic resolution.

The inshore area sampled includes four1 depth strata: 5-20 fathoms.21-35 fathoms. 36-55 fathoms. and >56 fathoms out to approximately the 12-mile limit.and five longitudinal regions based on oceanographic. geologic. and biological features(Figure 1). Together. 20 separate strata exist.With the addition of the fourth strata. the total survey area increased from ~3.626 nauticalmiles (NM2) to ~4.665 NM2. To keep sampling density of the original strata roughlyequivalent with previous surveys. an additional 15 stations were added to the originalgoal of 100 stations per survey. A target of 115 stations is selected for sampling in eachsurvey resulting in a sampling density of 1 station for every 40 NM2. Number of towsper stratum is apportioned according to its total area (Tables 1 and 2).SELECTION OF RANDOM STATIONSRandom stations are selected from a NOAA nautical chart in Arc ViewTM GIS overlainwith 1-NM2 grids. Each grid within each region is assigned a unique identificationnumber that serves as a call number. Grids are selected using an ExcelTM random numbergenerator. Tows approximately 1 NM long are proposed in each grid and plotted in PSeaWindplotTM (using charts of the NAD 1983 datum). From prior experience and localknowledge. some grids are classified as untowable during the plotting process. Due tothe large amount of fixed gear and the appeal to fishermen to cooperate with the surveyby clearing the tows. identifying good tow locations is a priority. If no towable bottomcan be found within a 2-mile radius. a new random number is chosen within the samestratum. Beginning and end points of each tow are identified in P-Sea Windplot. To theextent possible. for ease of identification by lobster industry members. tows follow loranlines. Loran C coordinates are converted to latitude/longitude degrees to the nearest0.001 decimal minutes.2SELECTION OF FIXED STATIONSAfter the initial survey in the fall of 2000. two stations per stratum were designated asfixed stations to be sampled on each subsequent survey. In areas where previous workhad been done. the stations were selected due to their historical importance3. In areas withno history. one station was selected as being roughly representative of the average catchfor its respective stratum and the other was randomly selected. After the addition of thefourth stratum in the spring of 2003. fixed stations were designated for that stratum usingthe same criteria.FISHING GEARTrawl design considerations for the survey include effectiveness of the gear forsampling the complex bottom in the nearshore areas of the Gulf of Maine andcomparability with previous and ongoing surveys by NMFS and MassachusettsDivision of Marine Fisheries. The net is a modified version of the shrimp netdesign used in Maine waters (Appendix A). designed to fish for a variety of nearbottomdwelling species without targeting any specific component. RobertTetrault. the vessels? owner. and net designer Jeff Flagg designed the net to fishfeet in length with nominal horsepower. Three identical nets were constructed forthis survey in the event of tearing or loss. Net tapers were cut to permit the shapeof the net to get maximum height while allowing the net to remain tight on thebottom. The net is shackled from the footrope to the frame with two 3/8th inchshackles to a banded wire that runs parallel with the footrope. Heavy rubber wingbobbins retard bottom wing lift at the net end of the bottom leg. Top legs are7/16th wire. 60 feet in length with soft eyes at each end. and bottom legs are 5/8thinch wire. 58 feet in length with two feet of 5/8th inch chain at the end where theleg attaches to the bottom wing for a total of 60 feet. Bottom legs are coveredwith 2 -3/8? cookies to prevent them from digging into the mud. The net isconstructed of 2-inch #24 polyethylene mesh. with a 1-inch (stretched measure)mesh liner in the cod end. Otter boards are #7.5 Bisons. Attached to the 70-foot.5/8th inch Rander?s Combination Wire Rope footrope is a roller frame strung onto?? IPS of 6x19 construction with a fiber core. The ten-foot wide bosom section ismade up of eight-inch rubber discs on six-inch centers along with eight evenlyspaced toggles. Spacing is maintained by smaller four-inch cookies strungbetween the discs. The two 29-foot wing sections are made up of six-inch rubberdiscs spaced 4 ? inches apart. with the same four inch cookies used to maintainspacing. Each wing section contains twelve toggles spaced evenly to facilitatefootrope attachment. The 5/8? Rander?s combination rope headrope has twentyeight8? center-hole. deep-sea net floats strung with 5/8? yellow polyethylenefloat line. Between surveys. the net is sent back to the manufacturer where it isreturned to specification (Appendix B).

With more than 1900 marine mammal encounters in The Bahamas. we are providing the only comprehensive documentation of the marine mammal fauna in this part of the world. Our research is based on the use of systematic boat-based surveys for describing the distribution and habitat use of different marine mammal species. We employ photo-identification techniques for the recognition of individual whales and dolphins. and we have developed new statistical approaches for using these data to determine abundance estimates and occupancy patterns. This photographic sampling is complemented by the collection of skin and faecal samples for molecular genetic analysis. which are being used to assess levels of genetic diversity and investigate the structuring of marine mammal populations. The dataset presented here includes both marine mammal and turtle sightings. The dataset consists of 89 stranding records between 1944 and 2005. including 15 species with Cuvier?s beaked whale being the most common. Marine mammal sightings data includes 444 sightings between 1988 and 2005. including sightings reported from the public. The dataset includes 1.934 BMMS vessel encounters with marine mammals between 1991 and 2005. comprising 20 different species. with the Atlantic bottlenose dolphin representing 60% of all encounters.

On site. no attempt to avoid structural features within a habitat such as a pile of conch shells. a sand patch or a tire in a seagrass or sand area should be made as these features affect fish communities and are real features of the habitats. Visibility at each site must be sufficient to allow for identification of fish at a minimum of 2m away. Once reasonable visibility is ascertained. the diver attaches a tape measure to the substrate and allows it to roll out as progress is made along the chosen compass heading for a distance of 25m. The transect should take 15 minutes regardless of habitat type or number of animals present. This allows more mobile animals the opportunity to swim through the transect. and standardizes the samples collected to allow for comparisons. As the tape roles out at a relatively constant speed. the diver records all fish species to the lowest taxonomic level possible that come within 2m of either side of the transect. Each survey is 100m2 in area (25m length X 4m width). To decrease the total time spent writing. four letter codes are used that consist of the first two letters of the genus name followed by the first two letters of the species name. In the rare case that two species have the same four-letter code. letters are added to the species name until a difference occurs. If the fish can only be identified to the family or genus level then this is all that is recorded. If the fish cannot be identified to the family level then no entry is necessary. The number of individuals per species is tallied in 5cm size class increments up to 35cm using visual estimation of fork length. If an individual is greater than 35cm. then an estimate of the actual fork length is recorded. Prior to 2002. fork lengths of fish greater than 35 cm were not always recorded. Although the habitat should not be altered in any manner by lifting or moving structure. the observer should record fish seen in holes. under ledges and in the water column. To identify. enumerate. or locate new individuals a diver may move off the centerline of the transect as long as they stay within the 4m transect width and do not look back along area already covered. The diver is allowed to look forward toward the end of the transect for the distance left along the transect (i.e. if the diver is at meter 15. he can look 10 meters distant. but if he is at meter 23. he can only look 2 meters ahead). This diver also takes photos of fishes to document color patterns and phases of the different species.Data Caveats: Overtime. some changes were made to the stratified random site selection process as follows: 1) Habitat strata initially consisted of hard bottom. sand. and seagrass. Sand and seagrass strata were subsequently combined into one soft bottom strata at all three locations (Puerto Rico. St. Croix. and St. John). This action was taken after the February 2002 mission to Puerto Rico. 2) A small subset of sites were resampled during each mission through June 2002 in Puerto Rico and October 2002 in St. Croix. These station names contain the letter 'P' indicating they are permanent stations. 3) The sample area in St. Croix has increased over time. Initially. samples were collected within historic Buck Island National Monument boundaries as well as outside up to a distance of 0.5 km from those boundaries. In February 2002 the sampling effort was increased to include the entire expanded monument boundaries. Finally in April 2003 the effort was increased again to include areas outside of the Monument for control sites. This area is now almost entirely enclosed within the East End Marine Park of St. Croix. 4) The habitat map utilized to stratify the samples in St. Croix was changed from the original habitat map created with a 1 acre minimum mapping unit to one with a 100m2 minimum mapping unit beginning with the April 2003 mission.Process_Date: 200202 Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Traps,NA, ,Oct-12,Count,NA,lat_long_general_bottomDepth_date

Noctural macromoths have been observed at a total of 263 sample sites throughout the Andrews Forest watershed since 1994. Only a limited subset of these sites is sampled each year. From 2004 to 2008. 20 sites were sampled consistently using a hierarchical sampling design stratified by elevation and vegetation type. Moths are sampled using blacklight traps deployed for one night every two weeks at each site from April through October. A total of 503 species have been observed. and approximately 300 species may be observed in any given year. The watershed can be divided into 13 distinct zones. The northwest ridge above the Andrews headquarters has the highest number of species (n = 321) and the lowest number of species occurred at upper Lookout Creek (n = 239). Each of 13 zones is missing ca. 200 of the 500 resident species. suggesting that heterogeneity in the landscape is important. A breakdown of the species into functional groups based on larval feeding habits: conifers. hardwood. herb. mix. unknown shows that 43% of Andrews species rely on a hardwoods and 63% rely on hardwoods and herbaceous angiosperms.

This grab enables fast sampling. The variability within replicates corresponds to about 13 %. what gives a difference in depth of 0.7 to 1.2 cm (Lie & Pamatmat. 1965). __Processing samples: Every sample (already stained with a Bengal Rose or eosin solution) is decanted (10 times) on a 1000 ?m sieve in order to separate the present fauna from the sediment. With this technique the residue of coarse sediment and fauna is pored into a measuring cup (5 l) and is brought into suspension with a strong jet of water. During this process the smaller and lighter organisms will go into suspension. whereas the heavier sediment and organisms remain on the bottom. The water containing the organisms is there after pored over a 1000 ?m sieve. All retained fauna is stored in a 4-8 % neutral formalin solution and stained with Bengal-Rose of eosin (if not done earlier). Both solutions colour all organic material. This enables easier sorting of the animals. After decantation the residue is checked for bigger and heavier organisms (e.g. Mollusca. Actinaria). Decantation must not be applied to fine sediment samples (< 1000 ?m) as all sediment is directly rinsed through the 1 mm sieve and what remains on the sieve can directly be fixated.     Identification: All organisms are counted and identified. if possible to species level. For some animal groups however this is not the case:Nematoda. Nemertinea. Sipunculida. Turbellaria. Actinaria. Oligochaeta and Copepoda are never identified to a higher level because they are not representative for the macrobenthos community. The sampling technique is not suited to quantify these groups neither.The identification of some taxa is still under discussion. Whether they should be identified up to species level or grouped into complexes is still not clear due to uncertain taxonomy (e.g. Phyllodoce maculata of P. mucosa,,NA,,,,,

Generating financial support from potential partners has been the most difficult obstacle to expansion beyond USFS lands. but many of those who were resistant early on are beginning to realize the power of birds as monitoring tools. and are starting to join forces to develop a more comprehensive statewide monitoring plan. - http://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/32091  (http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr191/psw_gtr191_0956-0962_hutti.pdf   --  http://www.montanadiscoveryfoundation.org/ASC_ptct_protocol_2007.pdf) Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Point counts,NA,1.

The 40 non-riparian sites are a subset of the 200 CAP- LTER points. We are using point counts to survey birds four times a year (January. April. July and October). During each session each point is visited by three birders who count all birds seen or heard for 15 minutes. Our goal is to study how different land-use forms affect bird abundance. distribution and diversity in the greater Phoenix area in order to predict and preserve high bird species diversity as urban development is proceeding. We have now just completed 3 years of monitoring. and are also beginning to see some of the sites changing due to new urban development. The results described below are based on analyses of the first two years? data. _______Bird Point Count Survey - GeneralA point count consists of one person standing in a specific location. for a fixed length of time. at a specific time of day. and counting all birds seen and heard within a specific distance (Fixed Radius.) or as far as the eye can see (Open Radius.)CAP-LTER uses 15-minute observation time spans.Counts are done within 4 hours of local sunrise.Counts are done using the Open Radius method.ADDITIONAL OBSERVERSThe primary observer may be accompanied to the plot area by an additional observer. However. only the primary observer should stand at plot center. and only the observations of the primary observer should be recorded on the data sheet. To avoid any bias that would invalidate the data collected. the secondary observer should not verbalize. point out birds. or give any non-verbal cues to the primary observer.Please note in the Notes column of the data sheet if an additional observer was present during the count.If the secondary observer sees something especially interesting that the primary observer did not see. it may be noted in the Notes column.COUNT CONDITIONSThe first point count should be started no earlier than local sunrise. The final point count should be finished no later than 4 hours past local sunrise.Do not conduct point counts in steady. or heavy rain. (It is okay to conduct counts in light. intermittent drizzle. but be sure to make note of this in the Weather line of the data sheet.)Do not conduct point counts in steady winds above 20 mph.APPROACHING THE PLOTApproach the plot as quietly as possible to minimize disturbance to the birds present.Make note in the Notes column of any birds flushed by the approach in case they do not return during the count.Stand quietly at plot center for 5 minutes before starting the count. This is essential to allow any disturbance caused by the approach to settle down.Use this 5-minute settle-down time to fill out the information at the top of the data sheet.Record in the Notes column any unusual circumstances around the plot. such as construction activity. or if a substantial part of the view is blocked. such as by a wall.CONDUCTING THE COUNTAfter the 5-minute settle-down period. set a watch or timer and conduct the count for 15 minutes. Rotate slowly in place and record all birds seen or heard. For each observation. note the following in the appropriate column of the data sheet.SpeciesUse the AOU code (7th Edition) if known. or write down the complete common name.If the species can not be positively identified. use the closest taxonomic affiliation. (It is better to record something as unknown rather than guessing.)Number of Individuals and DistanceUsually. a single individual bird will be recorded per line.Only record a number greater than one on a single line if birds of the same species are observed very close together. such as a flock or family group.If a mixed flock is observed. put each species on a separate line and note in the Notes column that they were part of a mixed flock.Record estimated flock sizes. only if you cannot count them all. in the following manner: 10-20 or 15+.Write the number of individuals observed in the appropriate distance columns (a meter - 39 inches - is a little bit longer than a yard.)If a bird moves during the count. record only the distance at which it was first observed.Try to be aware of bird movement to minimize counting birds twice.Fly-Throughs (FT)If a bird is seen flying through the count area. below the tallest structure or vegetation. but not observed taking off or landing. record it in the FT column only. not the distance columns. Note also the direction the bird was first observed.Higher flying birds can be noted in the Notes column if it is likely they are aerial screeners using the habitat. such as a hawk circling 100 feet overhead.You may note in the Notes column any unusual fly-overs. such as a flock of Sandhill Cranes.Seen (S) or Heard (H) ColumnsRecord with a check mark whether the bird was identified from sight or sound. or both. Use caution with similar-sounding birds. like Juncos and White-crowned Sparrows. or with mimics and imitators. like Grackles and Starlings.DirectionRecord the direction the bird was first observed. or heard. This may mean recording a bird heard to the south (S) even though you were facing northwest (N/W) at the time.Use the cardinal and midcardinal points of the compass (N. N/E. E. S/E. S. S/W. W. N/W) in this column.ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONSWear drab clothing and avoid bold patterns that might scare away some birds. or attract other ones.Do not pish. squeak. or use any other methods to encourage birds to show themselves. This would artificially inflate the bird densities recorded and invalidate the data collected.If the 15-minute count is interrupted for more than 30 seconds for any reason. such as a homeowner coming up to ask what you are doing. make a note of the interruption in the Notes column. An interruption of 5 minutes or more should also be reflected in the End Time column.Do not start or continue a count if personal safety is threatened in any way.

In previous studies the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) program has developed an integrated approach of paleoecological and historical reconstruction meteorological modeling air photo interpretation GIS analyses and field studies of vegetation and soils to address fundamental ecological questions concerning the rates direction and causes of vegetation change to evaluate controls over modern species and community distributions and landscape patterns and to provide critical background for conservation and restoration planning. In the current study we extend this approach to investigate the link between landscape history and the abundance distribution and dynamics of species communities and landscapes of the Cape Cod to Long Island coastal region including the islands of Martha's Vineyard Nantucket and Block Island. The study region includes many areas of high conservation priority that are linked geographically historically and ecologically. Despite the compelling rationale for examining this coastal region as a whole and for comparing its related though distinctive geographic areas an integrated and comprehensive study of the region has never been undertaken.We are investigating regional controls over landscape patterns and community distribution and will focus in detail on the dynamics of sandplain communities including grasslands heathlands barrens and woodlands which are unique components of this region and high priorities for conservation. In order to determine the historical and modern abundance and distribution of these community types and to relate these to historical patterns of land use fire windstorms and other disturbances we are developing: (1) GIS-based spatially explicit maps of land use land cover environment hurricane characteristics and cultural features across the region for the historical period (17th C to present) (2) pollen and charcoal diagrams for critical areas where data are currently unavailable and an integrated analysis of data from all studies across this region (3) analysis of the relationship between high priority communities (sandplain grasslands heathlands barrens and related communities) rare species and disturbance history (4) revised conceptual ecological models for sandplain communities and recommendations for ecological goals and management approaches.Methods:Species List - The data file lists all taxa recorded in the sample plots. Taxonomy follows Gleason and Cronquist (1991). In general codes are formed by taking the first four letters of the genus name and the first three letters of the species name. Where this causes confusion an eight letter code unique to each taxon is used.Plot Locations  - Plots are identified by a general location code (2-3 letters) and a plot number (1-999). These two identifiers are also combined into a single six-character code. Because the plots were sampled from a larger set of potential plot locations plot numbers are not necessarily sequential. Total number of plots = 776 (270 in 1999 389 in 2000 117 in 2001).Soil Chemistry - For plots sampled in 1999 (CJ series) the two pairs of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples were subsampled (1/8 cup per sample) and combined to make a single composite sample representing the plot which was then sent to Brookside Labs. For plots sampled in 2000 only one set of 0-15 and 15-30 cm samples was collected and ? cup of each was mixed to produce a composite 0-30 cm sample sent for analysis. In some samples concentrations of certain cations were below the detection limit of the analytical equipment,,NA,,,,,

Sampling was usually done on a biweekly schedule during the open water period and at least once through the ice at the deepest region of each lake. although in some years lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled monthly during the open-water period. On a few dates during high winds or during winter. sampling was conducted in slightly shallower water than at the deepest lake location. Tow depths for Mendota and Monona are included in the data set. Tow depths for Waubesa and Kegonsa have not been transcribed yet. but generally ranged between 9.5-10.0 meters and 7.5-8.0 meters. respectively. The conical zooplankton net had a 15-cm diameter opening (small net) and a net filtering area to opening area ratio of about 11. The net was made of Nitex screening with a mesh size of 75-80 um (#20 net) for all years except for 1976 when the mesh size was about 153 um (#10 net). The smaller-meshed net was initially chosen so that rotifers would be quantitatively collected along with crustacean zooplankton. For the small net. a vertical tow sample was taken from approximately 0.5 m off the lake bottom. The net was pulled to the lake surface at approximately 0.3 m per sec. After the net was raised and the sides rinsed. the sample was transferred to a bottle and preserved with formalin in early years. sugared formalin for a few years. and then formalin plus seltzer water was the preservative used after 1986. For each zooplankton sample obtained by the small net. organisms were identified to species and enumerated in three separate 1-mL subsamples obtained by a Hensen-Stemple pipette. Subsamples were taken directly from the sample bottle (sample volume ca. 150-250 mL). transferred to a 1-mL Sedgewick-Rafter cell and counted using a compound microscope. For each subsample. individual body lengths for all Daphnia encountered were recorded using an eyepiece micrometer,,NA,,,,,

We take one vertical tow with a Wisconsin Net (80um mesh) and a series of Schindler Patalas (53um mesh) samples spanning the water column. All samples are preserved in cold 95percent EtOH.After collection we combine subsamples of the individual Schindler Patalas trap samples to create one hypsometrically pooled sample for each lakeordate. The individual depth samples are discarded after pooling except from one August sampling date per year. The Hypsometrically Pooled sample and the Wisconsin Net sample are archived in the UW Zoology museum.We count zooplankton in one or two subsamples each representing 1.8L of lake water of the hypsometrically pooled samples to calculate zooplankton abundance. We count one sample date per month from the open water season and the February ice cover sample.  We identify individuals to genus or species take length measurements and count eggs and embryos.Protocol log:  1981-May1984 -- a 0.5m high 31L Schindler Patalas trap with 80um mesh net was used.

File names should be in lowercase.A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax). Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string. The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 percent of the total area.The cover (area) and height of each individual live (green) vegetative unit that falls within the one square meter quadrat is measured. A vegetative unit consists of an individual size class (as defined by a unique cover and height) of a particular species within a quadrat. Cover is quantified by counting the number of 10cm x 10cm squares filled by each vegetative unit.Niners and plexidecs are additional tools that help accurately determine the cover a vegetative unit. A niner is a small hand-held PVC frame that can be used to measure canopies. Like the larger PVC frame it is divided into 10cm x 10cm squares each square representing 1% of the total cover. However there are only nine squares within the frame hence the name ?niner.? A plexidec can help determine the cover of vegetative units with covers less than 1%. Plexidecs are clear plastic squares that are held above vegetation. Each plexidec represents a cover of 0.5% and has smaller dimensions etched onto the surface that correspond to 0.01% 0.05% 0.1% and 0.25% cover.It is extremely important that cover and height measurements remain consistent over time to ensure that regressions based on this data remain valid. Field crew members should calibrate with each other to ensure that observer bias does not influence data collection.Cover Measurements:Grasses-To determine the cover of a grass clump envision a perimeter around the central mass or densest portion of the plant excluding individual long leaves wispy ends or more open upper regions of the plant. Live foliage is frequently mixed with dead foliage in grass clumps and this must be kept in mind during measurement as our goal is to measure only plant biomass for the current season. In general recently dead foliage is yellow and dead foliage is gray. Within reason try to include only yellow or green portions of the plant in cover measurement while excluding portions of the plant that are gray. This is particularly important for measurements made in the winter when there is little or no green foliage present. In winter sometimes measurements will be based mainly on yellow foliage. Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant.Forbs-The cover of forbs is measured as the perimeter of the densest portion of the plant. If the forb is an annual it is acceptable to include the inflorescence in this measurement. If the forb is a perennial do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season.Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of cover and height. Cacti that occur as a dense ball/clump of stems (Opuntia leptocaulis) are measured using the same protocol as shrubs. Pincushion or hedgehog cacti (Escobaria vivipara Schlerocactus intertextus Echinocereus fendleri) that occur as single (or clustered) cylindrical stems are measured as a single cover.Yuccas-Make separate observations for the leaves and caudex (thick basal stem). Break the observations into sections of leaves that are approximately the same height and record the cover as the perimeter around this group of leaf blades. The caudex is measured as a single cover. The thick leaves of yuccas make it difficult to make a cover measurement by centering yourself over the caudex of the plant. The cover of the caudex may be estimated by holding a niner next to it or using a tape measure to measure to approximate the area.Height Measurements:Height is recorded as a whole number in centimeters. All heights are vertical heights but they are not necessarily perpendicular to the ground if the ground is sloping.Annual grasses and all forbs-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the inflorescence (if present). Otherwise measure to the top of the green foliage.Perennial grasses-Measure the height from the base of the plant to the top of the live green foliage. Do not include the inflorescence in the height measurement. The presence of live green foliage may be difficult to see in the winter. Check carefully at the base of the plant for the presence of green foliage. If none is found it may be necessary to pull the leaf sheaths off of several plants outside the quadrat. From this you may be able to make some observations about where green foliage is likely to occur.Perennial shrub and sub-shrubs-Measure the height from the base of the green foliage to the top of the green foliage ignoring all bare stems. Do not measure to the ground unless the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat.Foliage canopy cover:Cover and height are recorded for all separate vegetative units that fall within an infinite vertical column that is defined by the inside edge of the PVC-frame. A vegetative unit consists of an individual species with a unique cover and height. This includes vegetation that is rooted outside of the frame but has foliage that extends into the vertical column defined by the PVC-frame.As mentioned above cover is quantified by counting the number or fraction of 10 cm x 10 cm squares intercepted by each vegetative unit. It is possible to obtain a total percent cover greater than 100 for a quadrat because vegetative units often overlap (especially in shrubs and succulents). For perennial plants cover is based only on the vegetative portion of the plant (stem and leaf). For annual plants cover is based on both vegetative and reproductive (inflorescence) portions of the plant.If the cover of a vegetative unit is less than 1 the increments used are as follows: 0.01 0.05 0.1 0.25 0.5 and 0.75. If cover is between 1 and 5 increments of 0.5 are used and if greater than 5 increments of 1 are used.  Finally if the cover is greater than 15 the total canopy cover is divided into smaller units and the cover and heights of each observation measured separately. This reduces the size of harvest samples.

Net primary production is a fundamental ecological variable that quantifies rates of carbon consumption and fixation. Estimates of NPP are important in understanding energy flow at a community level as well as spatial and temporal responses to a range of ecological processes.Above-ground net primary production is the change in plant biomass represented by stems flowers fruit and and foliage over time and incoporates growth as well as loss to death and decomposition. To measure this change the vegetation variables in this dataset including species composition and the cover and height of individuals are sampled twice yearly (spring and fall) at permanent 1m x 1m plots within each site. A third sampling at Site C is performed in the winter. The data from these plots is used to build regressions correlating biomass and volume via weights of select harvested species obtained in SEV157 Net Primary Productivity (NPP) Weight Data. This biomass data is included in SEV182 Seasonal Biomass and Seasonal and Annual NPP for Core Research Sites.Methods: Locating the Sampling Quadrats: Site P the pinon-juniper woodland site (Cerro Montosa) is set-up differently than the other core sites. In order to accommodate the different habitat types groups of transects (i.e. plots) were set up along north (N) and south (S) facing slopes as well as along vegas (V) and ridges (R). Transects on the first two plots consist of 40 quads each (10 quadrants for each of four habitat types). Plot one is slightly west of plot three and plot two is slightly west of the weather station. Plot three is located on a wide piedmont which consists of four transects with five quadrats on each.Collecting the Data: Net primary production data is collected twice each year spring and fall for all sites. The Five Points Creosote Core Site is also sampled in winter. Spring measurements are taken in April or May when shrubs and spring annuals have reached peak biomass. Fall measurements are taken in either September or October when summer annuals have reached peak biomass but prior to killing frosts. Winter measurements are taken in February before the onset of spring growth.Vegetation data is collected on a palm top computer. A 1-m2 PVC-frame is placed over the fiberglass stakes that mark the diagonal corners of each quadrat. When measuring cover it is important to stay centered over the vegetation in the quadrat to prevent errors caused by angle of view (parallax). Each PVC-frame is divided into 100 squares with nylon string. The dimensions of each square are 10cm x 10cm and represent 1 percent of the total area.The cover (area) and height of each individual live (green) vegetative unit that falls within the one square meter quadrat is measured.

A niner is a small hand-held PVC frame that can be used to measure canopies. Like the larger PVC frame it is divided into 10cm x 10cm squares each square representing 1% of the total cover. However there are only nine squares within the frame hence the name ?niner.? A plexidec can help determine the cover of vegetative units with covers less than 1%.

Within reason try to include only yellow or green portions of the plant in cover measurement while excluding portions of the plant that are gray. This is particularly important for measurements made in the winter when there is little or no green foliage present. In winter sometimes measurements will be based mainly on yellow foliage. Stoloniferous stems of grasses that are not rooted should be ignored. If a stem is rooted it should be recorded as a separate observation from the parent plant.Forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs (non-creosote)-The cover of forbs shrubs and sub-shrubs is measured as the horizontal area of the plant. If the species is an annual it is acceptable to include the inflorescence in this measurement if it increases cover. If the species is a perennial do not include the inflorescence as part of the cover measurement. Measure all foliage that was produced during the current season including any recently dead (yellow) foliage. Avoid measuring gray foliage that died in a previous season.Cacti-For cacti that consist of a series of pads or jointed stems (Opuntia phaecantha Opuntia imbricata) measure the length and width of each pad to the nearest cm instead of cover and height. Cacti that occur as a dense ball/clump of stems (Opuntia leptocaulis) are measured using the same protocol as shrubs.

Do not measure to the ground unless the foliage reaches the ground.Plants rooted outside but hanging into a quadrat-Do not measure the height from the ground. Measure only the height of the portion of the plant that is within the quadrat. Creosote Measurements: To measure creosote (i.e. Larrea tridenta) break the observations into two categories:1.) Small individual clusters of foliage on a branch (i.e. branch systems): Measure the horizontal cover of each live (i.e. green) foliage cluster ignoring small open spaces (keeping in mind the 15% guideline stated above). Then measure the vertical height of each cluster from the top of the foliage to a plane created by extending a line horizontally from the bottom of the foliage. Each individual foliage cluster within a bush is considered a separate observation.2.) Stems: Measure the length of each stem from the base to the beginning of live (i.e. green) foliage. Calculate the cumulative total of all stem measurements. This value is entered under height with the species as stem for each quadrat containing creosote. All other variable receive a default entry of 1 for creosote stem measurements.Do not measure dead stems or areas of dead foliage. If in doubt about whether a stem is alive scrape the stem with your fingernail and check for the presence of green cambium.Recording the Data: Excel spreadsheets are used for data entry and file names should begin with the overall study (npp) followed by the date (mm.dd.yy) and the initials of the recorder (.abc).

After having been submitted to logging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries followed by a major fire in 1923 the forest is currently in a transition state dominated by pioneer canopy tree species. The sampling design is based on the annual re-sampling of 43 permanent 400-m2 plots along five transects running parallel to an elevation gradient from a lake (Lac Croche) to the top of a hill. Abundances of all understory vascular plants (tree seedlings herbs and shrubs) are included in the data set and are expressed either as absolute densities or cover classes depending on life form. The location and elevation of each plot as well as some key environmenatl descriptors such as slope rockiness canopy openness age of the largest tree basal area of mature trees and a number of soil variables are also available. The Lac Croche data set should prove useful for testing hypotheses about forest vegetation dynamics at different sacles as well as to test new statistical tools developed for the analysis of the spatio-temporal variation of plant distributions.

Geographic Coverage: The Scheldt (Dutch Schelde French Escaut) is a 350 km long river in northern France western Belgium and the southwestern part of the Netherlands. Its name is derived from an adjective corresponding to Old English sceald shallow Modern English shoal Low German schol Frisian skol and Swedish sk?ll thin. Bounding Coordinates:  50.58 51.51 / 2.81 4.58 (min max Latitude / min max Longitude)   Taxonomic Coverage: All species in this dataset are fishes (Actinopterygii Cephalaspidomorphi) except for the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) which is an invasive arthropod and the common littoral crab (Carcinus maenas). The top 3 recorded species are Rutilus rutilus (27%) Gobio gobio (10%) and Anguilla anguilla (7%).         Sampling Methods: The three sampling methods that were applied in this project (cooling water intertidal and subtidal fykes) proved to be complementary and each are useful to describe a different aspect of the migration of diadromous fishes. The volunteer network (intertidal fykes) has a high temporal and spatial resolution. Especially the catadromous species that use the estuary as a foraging and nursery area were caught in the intertidal fyke nets. Subadult shads and downstream migrating juvenile lampreys were only caught in the cooling water of the powerplant of Doel. In addition the fish monitoring of the cooling water in Doel started in 1991 which allows us to investigate long-term trends. The subtidal fyke nets that were deployed underneath the migration barriers proved to be efficient in catching the fishes during their spawning run. During their upstream migration anadromous fishes accumulate underneath the barriers where they can be caught in large numbers. migration of diadromous fishes data from the river Scheldt Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",Sites,NA,1.

There was no change inoperation that can result in significant changes in the pumped volume. so the combined water flow wasconstant over years. However. each generator was shut down for maintenance in turn for about onemonth during winter to spring seasons. which causes the combined water flow velocity to decrease 50%.The sample was collected in opportune days in order to avoid sampling during the maintenance period.Over 6.000.000 m3 of water. taken from the near-shore waters off northeastern Taiwan. was used monthlyby these two nuclear power plants.The intake of the first plant was built on a straighter shoreline than that of the second plant. which islocated in an open bay along the Yehliu Cape.

The main site used was Shackelton Point. Because one site (Billington Bay) was only sampled some years. it is notincluded in the weekly average table. This table averages data taken from five sites (Shackelton Point. Buoy 109. 117 and 125. andThree Mile Bay) collected during the same sampling week. Sampling week is identified with a number that in most cases is the sameas the week number of the year. On a small number of occasions. a sampling was conducted on a Friday to Sunday for the followingweek. The net used was a 153-um mesh nylon net (0.5 m diameter) towed vertically from 0.5 m off the sediment surface to the watersurface. The efficiency of the net was measured with flow meters from 1999 to present. If flow meter readings indicate a malfunctionor human error (efficiencies below 50% and above 125%) and when no flow meter was used. we assumed an efficiency of 87.4%(average of the 1999 to 2010 sampling period 87.4% SD 9.5%.

Drain the trap through the net and cup. swirling the cup until the liquid level is below the mesh windows. Remove the cup from the net and pull out the center pin to drain the sample into jar. then rinse cup and pin several times with 95percent EtOH into the sample jar.Sample Collection: Wisconsin NetLower the net to the bottom sample depth. Pull it up slowly. at a rate of about 3 seconds per meter. A slow haul prevents the net from pushing water and plankton away from the mouth of the net. Drain the cup until the water level is below the lower window. then pour contents into the sample jar. Rinse the cup with 95percent EtOH several times. adding the rinse to the sample jar.Hypsometric PoolingRationale and DefinitionIn March 1986 the LTER Zooplankton Group decided to pool the discrete depth Schindler Patalas trap samples into one pooled sample per lake-date for counting. Counting pooled samples rather than all of the depth samples reduces the time to produce zooplankton count data. The group hoped to count pooled samples from the entire backlog of uncounted samples and eventually to count samples shortly after collection.Samples are pooled considering lake hypsometry and. therefore. represent the entire lake. Previously. unpooled samples (2-9 samples per lake-date) or samples pooled considering only a water column were counted. Hypsometric pooling allows us to consider the zooplankton community as representing the entire lake. as our other limnological methods do. instead of just a column of water.Lake hypsometry is a three dimensional image of a lake or basin. In a simplified example of hypsometry. a lake is similar to a cone filled with water. If the cone were divided into three layers by two equidistant horizontal planes. the volumes in those layers would be very different from each other. The uppermost layer would contain the most water. Similarly. the upper depths typically contain most of the volume of a lake.Pooling is the creation of a new sample from subsamples of the Schindler trap samples collected from one lake-date. The volume of each subsample used to make the pooled sample reflects the depth range the sample represents and the volume of water that range represents relative to the entire lake volume. Samples pooled in this manner are called HP samples. for hypsometrically pooled. and are referred to as volume weighted because the volume of lake water each depth sample represents determines the subsample size.In sum. the advantages to this method of pooling are quicker turnover time and representation of the entire lake in a volume weighted fashion. Disadvantages of this method include the time required to pool subsamples. errors introduced during pooling. and the loss of more specific depth information.Pooling ProcedureAllow the sample jars to air dry for a day or two. Weigh the Wisconsin Net sample and record the weight on the Volume by Weight form. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a Sharpee brand permanent marker.Add 95percent EtOH to each Schindler trap sample to bring liquid volume up to a weight of 105g. measured by weighing the sample jar with lid on the balance. If sample jars already contain more than 105g of liquid. allow some of the volume to evaporate in the hood. and then bring up to 105g. Record the final weight of jar plus sample plus EtOH on the Volume by Weight form.Calculate the subsample volumes. called target volumes. using the hypsometric table for each lake. Record these volumes on the Volume by Weight form.Mix the first sample gently and thoroughly by tilting the jar from side to side. Measure the target volume into a plastic graduated cylinder. Pour the subsample quickly and smoothly because the plankton settle out quite rapidly. Choose the smallest size graduated cylinder that can measure the target volume in one aliquot. Add the subsample to the labeled HP jar. Repeat with all other depth samples. When all of the subsamples have been added to the HP sample. rinse each graduated cylinder into the HP jar with several small volumes of EtOH.Place the HP sample in the hood to evaporate the excess volume of EtOH. The final weight of the HP sample should be 105g. Mark the liquid level on the jar with a Sharpee brand permanent marker. If the samples are from the August quarterly. pour the remainder of each Schindler sample into a labeled jar for archival. For all other sample dates. discard what is left of the Schindler samples. Rinse and air dry the field sample jars.Sample Storage and Record KeepingStore samples in cardboard records boxes obtained from UW Stores. storing samples from each lake in a separate box.

Sampling was usually done on a biweekly schedule during the open water period and at least once through the ice at the deepest region of each lake. although in some years lakes Waubesa and Kegonsa were only sampled monthly during the open-water period. On a few dates during high winds or during winter. sampling was conducted in slightly shallower water than at the deepest lake location. Tow depths for Mendota and Monona are included in the data set. Tow depths for Waubesa and Kegonsa have not been transcribed yet. but generally ranged between 9.5-10.0 meters and 7.5-8.0 meters. respectively. The conical zooplankton net had a 15-cm diameter opening (small net) and a net filtering area to opening area ratio of about 11. The net was made of Nitex screening with a mesh size of 75-80 um (#20 net) for all years except for 1976 when the mesh size was about 153 um (#10 net). The smaller-meshed net was initially chosen so that rotifers would be quantitatively collected along with crustacean zooplankton. For the small net. a vertical tow sample was taken from approximately 0.5 m off the lake bottom. The net was pulled to the lake surface at approximately 0.3 m per sec. After the net was raised and the sides rinsed. the sample was transferred to a bottle and preserved with formalin in early years. sugared formalin for a few years. and then formalin plus seltzer water was the preservative used after 1986. For each zooplankton sample obtained by the small net. organisms were identified to species and enumerated in three separate 1-mL subsamples obtained by a Hensen-Stemple pipette.

A diver swims the length of the 40 m transect approximately 1m above the bottom at a constant deliberate speed and records all fish passing through the sampling area. Fish size is measured as total length (TL) estimated to the nearest cm. Care is taken by the diver to not count the same individual more than once if it leaves and re-enters the sampling area. Surveys are carried out by only a select number of highly trained divers whose sampling techniques have been standardized in order to minimize observer bias. The horizontal visibility along the transect is measured and recorded for each sampling event. The number of fish taxa sampled is not fixed as all species of reef fish encountered in the sampling area are recorded. Species that are difficult to identify underwater are lumped into broader taxonomic categories (e.g.. flatfish in the family Bothidae) to facilitate sampling.  Several species of small bottom-dwelling fish are difficult to accurately count and size during the reef fish survey due to their cryptic appearance and behavior. Individuals in a select group of these species are counted and sized in a separate survey done in the four contiguous 20 m x 1 m swaths that centered on the 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver carefully searches the area within each swath taking time to look on the undersides of ledges and in crevices. and within understory vegetation for select species of small cryptic fish which are purposely not counted in the reef fish survey. Understory algae are brushed aside during the search. but no organisms or boulders are physically moved. Size is recorded as total length (TL) to the nearest cm.

UPC data are collected at 80 points uniformly positioned within a 1 m wide area centered along each 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver records all organisms intersecting an imaginary vertical line passing through each point and species percent cover is determined as the fraction of points a species intercepts x 100. A species is only recorded once at a given point even if it intersects the imaginary line multiple times. Using this technique the percent cover of all species combined on a transect can exceed 100%. but the percent cover of any individual species cannot. Species are recorded from top- down as they are encountered and are entered from left to right on the datasheet in such a way that primary space holders occupy the left side of the ā€SP_CODEā€¯ column. Species growing attached to other organisms are not counted. except those species growing on the ornate tube worm (Diopatra ornata). Additionally. the substrate type under each point is recorded and if the substrate is sand. then the depth of the sand is measured to the nearest cm. Mobile organisms occurring at a sampling point are not counted and are moved so that the species and substrate beneath them can be recorded.

The number of grabs taken ateach station varied with type of grab used. This data can be foundin Table 2. In some instances a substrate sample was taken from onehalf of one grab sample and the remaining portion was discarded.leaving only one half of the grab t o be combined with the other grabsamples from the station.Only adequate grab samples were retained. An adequate sampleis one in which the grab samples the bottom evenly. samples atleast 2 liters of substrate. and is closed when brought to the surface.Depth of penetratlon into the substrate may vary with type of substrate.but at most stations depth of penetration was from 6 to 10 cm.After the collection of a set of grabs from a station. substrateand organisms were washed on a stainless steel screen with a mesh sizeof 0.5 mm. Retained invertebrates and debris were preserved in formalin(1 part formaldehyde with 9 parts water) for transporting to the ArcticBiological Station where they were processed.Processing consists of sorting. identifying. counting and weighingspecimens in each sample.Each sample was sorted by hand using a Wild M5 dissectingmicroscope. Specimens were identified to species in most cases andcounts of specimens for each species were recorded. Speciesidentification was not attempted for a few taxa. such as nematodes.nemerteans. hydroids . and bryozoans. and although several species maybe involved. they were listed by taxon on a collective basis. In asimilar manner sponges. bryozoans. hydroids. and other colonial formswere regarded as one individual . Protozoans were arbitrarily excludedfrom the study. Stations 75-012 to 75-015 (Tables 90 to 93) includefreshwater species which were separated but not identified. Thesespecies were not included in the Beaufort Sea species list (Table 4).After sorting and identification. specimens were dried (dryingoven at 100?C overnight) and weighed on a Sartorius gravimetric balanceto four decimal places. The dry weight excludes tubes and shells. butno effort was made to eliminate gut contents. The calcareous partsof echinoderms and the skeletal parts of sponges are included in thedry weight because of difficulty in separating organic and inorganicparts.Data are presented on a m2 basis (Tables 8-108). For each samplenumber and weight of individuals of each species were multiplied by afactor t o convert sample values to m2 values.

I obtained bibliographic information from the recent database of Italian Lepidoptera (Parenzan and Porcelli 2006). When possible I used the year of collection as reported in literature instead of publication date. I also included collection data from hand netting between 1999 and 2008 and by Malaise trapping between 1999 and 2004 in several different localities of Elba (Dapporto and Cini 2007 Dapporto and Strumia 2008a b).

Sampling methods:Microplankton abundanceData analysed were collected from 1992 to 2002 at 788 sites. See Fig. 1 and Table 1 for a detailed site description. Seawater samples were collected from different depths (most of them in surface waters) from CTD Niskin bottles. For later microplankton cell counts. it is very important to handle seawater with care. as some organisms are very sensitive to turbulence (Gifford and Caron 2000). Water samples were taken from the Niskin bottle and immediately preserved with 1ā€“5 % acid-Lugol's iodine solution (Throndsen 1978). Samples were labelled and stored in cold. dark conditions during transportation to the laboratory.NutrientsWe only have in situ nutrients data for AMT cruises. Samples were taken from the underway pumping system between stations. from vertical profiles at each station. or both. However. we only included samples obtained during the daily CTD casts coincident with the microplankton sampling. Water samples from the CTD/Rosette system (SeaBird) were sub-sampled into clean Nalgene bottles. Sample analysis was completed within 3 h of sampling. so no samples were stored.Other variablesFor Chlorophyll. between 200 and 300 mL of sea water from each depth in the water column were sequentially filtered through 0.2 Āµm. 2 Āµm and 20 Āµm polycarbonate filters. Chl a was extracted from filters in 90% acetone at 20Ā°C for 12 to 24 hours. Samples were measured on a Turner 10-AU fluorometer calibrated with pure Chl a.Temperature and PAR were obtained either from CTD data or underway records from the ship. For those stations where it was impossible to obtain data. these were retrieved from satellite data.2. AnalysisMicroplankton abundanceMicroplankton identification and cell counts was carried out by Derek S. Harbour at the Plymouth Marine Laboratory using inverted microscopy following the UtermĆ¶hl technique (UtermĆ¶hl 1958). The ''Water quality - Guidance standard for routine microscopic surveys of phytoplankton using UtermĆ¶hl technique'' (BS EN 15204:2006) was followed:Microplankton samples. preserved in Lugol's iodine and formalin. were settled in sedimentation chambers while acclimatized to room temperature. to ensure a random distribution of cells. After this. sample bottles were rotated to help re-suspension and separation. Sub-samples with volumes between 10 and 256 mL were later transferred to plankton settling chambers. A variable area of the chamber bottom was counted under the microscope. The size of that area varies with species and abundance and under some circunstances different species were counted in different settled volumes to obtain consistency and reproducibility in the counts. At least 100 cells of each of the more abundant species were counted. Settlement duration varied between 4h cm-1 for Lugol's iodine and 16 h cm-1 for formaldehyde samples.Once the settling process finished. cells were identified. where possible. to species/genus level and assigned to different functional groups: Flagellates. Heterotrophic flagellates. Diatoms. Coccolithophores. Dinoflagellates. Heterotrophic dinoflagellates. and Ciliates. It should be noted that heterotrophic refers to organisms that do not contain pigments.Abundance data for each species at each station was calculated in cells per mL. Dimensions of individual species were measured in Āµm units using digital measurements and calibrated against an ocular micrometer. Using the corresponding geometric shapes. these measurements were converted to volume using the (Kovala and Larrance 1966) methodology. Once this was done. cell volumes were converted to carbon (pg cell-1) using the formulae of Menden-Deuer and Lessard (2000).Since all the plankton counts were obtained by light inverted microscopy they do not include pico-cyanobacteria. like Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. The database adequately samples the microplankton size range and part of the nanoplankton abundance. small eukaryotes are also too small to be identified to the species level by light-microscopy. The UtermĆ¶hl technique is restricted to cells larger than 10 Āµm (within the nanoplankton size range). Smaller cells do not settle quantitatively even after Lugol's iodine addition and cells are too small to classify to the species level.NutrientsTo analyse nutrients. a Technicon AAII (four-five channel depending on the cruise) segmented-flow auto-analyser was used. Protocols used were different for each nutrient: phosphate and silicate were analysed as described by Kirkwood (1989). Nitrate and nitrite was analysed using a modified version of Grasshoff's method (Grasshoff 1976). as described by Brewer and Riley (1965). These were measured as nirate plus nitrite. since the nitrate was determined as nitrite using a copper-cadmium reduction column to reduce it to nitrite. We later calculated nitrate as the difference between the nitrite measure and the nitrite plus nitrate measure. Ammonium was measured only in cruise AMT6. The chemical methodology used was the described by (Mantoura and Woodward 1983). All results are presented as Āµmol L-1 of the elements nitrogen. phosphorus and silica.

Pitfall trap grids have been installed at three creosotebush sites. three grassland sites. and three mesquite sites. and two tarbush sites. Each grid consists of 4 x 4 rows of traps at 15 meter intervals. Each pitfall trap is 40 cm deep. and lined with tin can cylinders. A polyethylene funnel is set on a container in each trap. Each trap has a ceramic tile cover which is used to close the trap during non-sampling periods. Traps were opened for two consecutive weeks every month for the period 16 June 1989 to 23 August 1991. For the period post-August 1991. traps were opened for two consecutive weeks quarterly (Feb. May. Aug. Oct). During the summer traps are checked every three days. during the winter they are checked once each week. Lizards are removed from the containers and information is recorded on data sheets. Objectives. Desertification is hypothesized to have altered the spatial and temporal availability of resources required by the biota. Results of desertification on the Jornada include changes to shrub dominated communities and major soil changes. We hypothesize that these shifts in vegetation have changed resources temporally for many of the consumers. If grassland systems respond to rainfall without significant lags. but shrub systems do not. then consumer species should reflect these differences. In addition. shifts from grassland to shrubland results in greater structural heterogeneity of the habitats. We have hypothesized that consumer populations. diversity. and densities of some consumers will be higher in grasslands than in shrublands. Diversity and/or densities are hypothesized to be related to the NPP of the sites. Data will be collected for the duration of the LTER program in order to provide data to test these hypotheses.Protocol for Lizard Pitfalls - OVERVIEW.A grid of 16 pitfall traps is located at each consumer plot. Each trap is 40 cm deep and contains an inner plastic container and funnel. A ceramic tile is placed over each trap. For a 2-week period each sample period. the tiles are raised on one side. and the traps are checked every 3 days in summer and once a week in winter. Individual lizards are taken from the traps. identified. sexed. measured. and weighed. Each lizard was clipped with a unique number using the codes on the diagram on the field data sheets. Toe clipping was done from 1989 to 1995. Starting in March 1995 toe clipping was terminated and lizards were instead marked with a black sharpie marking pen to provide a temporary mark to determine recapture status over a particular 2-week trapping period. A black mark is made posterior to the cloaca on the ventral base of the tail. Trapping grid is a 4x4 with 15 meter interval between traps.I. INTRODUCTION. In conjunction with net primary production studies. consumer and faunal studies are conducted at or near NPP sites using pitfall traps. We use live traps. not employing ethylene glycol or other killing/preservative agents. with traps checked once a week at the minimum.

During 1989ā€“1990 all trees ? 30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were sampled in five northā€“south transects 20 m wide and 180 to 370 m long covering a total area of 3.12 ha. In 1992ā€“1993 additional rectangular plots were established bringing the area sampled to 5.07 ha in total. In all 3870 trees were identified tagged mapped and provided with permanent dendrometer bands. Since then the sampled area has been regularly censused at 3ā€“5 year intervals recording tree recruitment mortality and growth. We present data from censuses conducted in 1990ā€“1993 1994 1997ā€“1998 2001ā€“2002 2007 and 2010. These data have been used to study the natural forest dynamics and to calibrate spatially explicit simulation models. ____ Sampling design consists of five northā€“south oriented transects viz. A B C D and E each 20 m wide 180 to 370 m long and 100 m apart center to center. The 5 transects were installed in 1989ā€“1990 and collectively represent a 3.12-ha systematic sample of the forest compartment whose main dendrometric and floristic characteristics are given in Pascal and PĆ©lissier (1996). Subsequently additional rectangular sampling plots viz. H R and S which overlap the transects and represent an additional area of 1.95 ha were established in 1990ā€“1993 to study the dynamics of the forest in particular topographic situations (PĆ©lissier 1997 1998). A piece of R source code is given in section III-V-D below to extract data according to various sampling configurations. Table 1 gives a summary of plot size and location. Because of the uneven site topography (see B.1.Watersheds and hydrology) each plot was designed as a grid of 10 Ć— 10 m contiguous elementary quadrats adjusted to account for local slope angle. The purpose of the correction was to ensure that each side of a quadrat was approximately 10 m flat so that it contains in total a 100 m2 area in planar projection. The slope angle (alpha) was measured along each quadrat sides which length parallel to the ground was adjusted to l = 10/cos(alpha). In order to accurately locate the trees in (xy) co-ordinates within each quadrat they were temporarily delineated with a plastic rope. All trees from 30 cm girth at breast height (gbh) were inventoried measured tagged mapped and identified to species. The point of girth measurement of each tree (pom) was marked with paint in the initial inventory and then fitted with a permanent dendrometer band. For mapping the trees within each quadrat the flat distance from the centre of the trunk base to the nearest quadrat boundary was measured in two perpendicular directions parallel to the rope. Each quadrat was mapped in the field at a scale of 1:100 with indication of tree locations main rocks fallen trees stream courses trails etc. These maps are stored at IFP Botany Lab. Instrumentation: Slope angles were measured with a 1-degree precision using a Suunto hand-held clinometer. Distance measurements were taken with a 1-cm precision thanks to a 20 m fiberglass tape. Initial tree girths were measured at 1.30 m from the ground or above the buttresses with a precision of 0.1 cm using a 3 or 5 m flexible steel tape. A calibrated 1.30 m stick was used to determine pom height. The dendrometer bands were prepared by technical IFP staff using stainless steel bands adjusted to tree girth and equipped with a 1:50 vernier (Hall 1944,,NA,,,,,

Surveys were conducted between 04:30 and 08:00 EDT and most were completed by 06:30 EDT. Observers listened quietly for ten minutes at each of five stations. [In 2003 we increased the 5-species point count length from five to ten minutes in order to gather more information and to achieve methodological consistency with the all-species protocols and with Canada?s High-Elevation Landbird Program.]They recorded the number of each focal species seen or heard during three time periods: 0-3 minutes 3-5 minutes and 5-10 minutes. If Bicknell?s Thrush was not detected during or between point counts surveyors returned to each point immediately after the full route survey and broadcast a one-minute recording of the bird?s vocalizations in order to elicit a response from present but silent birds. A two-minute listening period followed each broadcast. [Prior to 2003 the broadcast duration was three minutes.]Audio playbacks were discontinued upon detection of one or more individuals. If no Bicknell?s Thrush responded to the broadcasts the status of the species at that location was classified as unknown. Monitors who completed their surveys without encountering Bicknell?sThrush were asked to conduct follow-up audio playback surveys at dusk or dawn before 15 July (after Atwood et al. 1996). If no observations of Bicknell?s Thrush were made during the second visit the species was presumed to be absent from that site. Site selection was based on a GIS model of potential Bicknell?s Thrush habitat that incorporates elevation. latitude. and forest type (see Lambert et al. 2005). The model depicts conifer-dominated forests above an elevation threshold that drops 81.63 m for every one-degree increase in latitude (-81.63 m/1? latitude). The threshold?s slope corresponds closely with the latitude-elevation relationship for treeline in the Appalachian Mountain chain. which is -83 m/1? latitude (Cogbill and White 1991). Four routes have been established on peaks lying below the elevation threshold. while forty routes cross the threshold due to the limited availability of trails or land area above the threshold. We made an attempt to randomize site selection by randomly assigning priority ranks to discrete units of high-elevation habitat. However. the choice of sites was constrained by the availability of volunteers and the location of existing trails. When placing routes. we favored discrete starting points (e.g. trail junction). extensive conifer stands. and upper elevations. Volunteers establishing a route for the first time placed five points at 200- to 250-m intervals along a mapped course. Monitors submitted a detailed description of each station in order to facilitate its location in future years. 10% quinaldine solution spread throughout the study site to anesthertize fish.

Two of these collections (March and October 1979) were excluded from analyses because a combination of storms and insufficient low tides (-0.15 m) prevented adequate sampling. The remaining 13 collections were made during low tides ranging from -0.24 to -0.46 m. Sampling consisted of spreading a 10% solution of quinaldine (an anesthetic) throughout the study site until fully anesthetized fishes were observed. Specimens were then collected by hand or with dip nets and sampling was terminated after a complete search of the study site failed to yield additional specimens. This included overturning rocks and boulders by hand which were then replaced with minimal disruption. Three investigators have shown that quinaldine collections yield relatively unbiased estimates of the relative abun- dances of fishes in intertidal areas (Gibson 1967b,,NA,,,,,

(1994) was applied also during the additional seventeen years. For a recent general description and discussion of the method we refer to Bibby et al. (2000). The method is also called spot mapping? after William (1936) and it is similar to the method used in the Common Bird Census in the UK (Marchant et al. 1990) and the Breeding Bird Census in North America (Robbins 1970). The observer walks slowly through the plot putting down all bird observations in their proper positions on a map paying particular attention to recording simultaneous presence of males in adjacent territories. Species maps are then constructed from the visit map records. The species maps are used to evaluate the number of distinct clusters of records which are believed to represent territories. The method is of course prone to errors both when recording the birds in the field and when evaluating the number of territories from the species maps. Furthermore the number of territories is never stable throughout the breeding season: some birds die some fail to breed successfully and leave their territories and some arrive late and establish new territories. However for our analysis it is not essential to know the exact number of territories in every particular part of every breeding season. Instead standardization (recording birds and evaluating the species maps in the same way every year) is the key to reliable comparisons and we did our best to achieve this. We made ten visits per year in all but two years (nine visits in 2007 and 2009). They were distributed from April through June (always after 9 April and before 18 June) but with variation according to the arrival of spring. All surveys were made by the same person one of the authors (Ann Mari Thorner). Since AMT also carried out all surveys in 1987?1992 there is now a series of no less than twenty-one years with the same observer. This ensures that the new results are comparable with the data from before 1993. Each visit took between two and three hours so the minimum annual survey effort was twenty hours. A cluster of records was accepted as a territory if it contained at least three records (for a few very late arriving species two records was considered sufficient,,NA,,,,,

Experimental Design There are 2 study sites the Five Points grassland site and the Rio Salado creosotebush site. Each study site is 1 km by 0.5 km in area. Three rodent trapping webs and four replicate experimental blocks of plots are randomly located at each study site to measure vegetation responses to the exclusion of small mammals. Each block of plots is 96 meters on each side. Each block of plots consists of 4 experimental study plots each occupying 1/4 of each block. The blocks of study plots are all oriented on a site in a X/Y coordinate system with the top to the north. Treatments within each block include one unfenced control plot (Treatment: C) one plot fenced with hardware cloth and poultry wire to exclude rodents and rabbits (Treatment: R) and one plot fenced only with poultry wire to exclude rabbits (Treatment: L). The three treatments were randomly assigned to each of the four possible plots in each block independently and their arrangements differ from block to block. Each of the three plots in a replicate block are separated by 20 meters. Each experimental measurement plot measures 36 meters by 36 meters.

Study area - The Porcupine Abyssal Plain is situated off the southwest coast of Ireland in the Northeast Atlantic. All the samples were collected between 1989 and 2005. Most samples were taken within a 20 nautical mile (37 km) radius of a central position for time series studies (48?50?N and 16?30?W) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). This site became known as the ?BENGAL Station? following a major European project on seabed biology and geochemistry that focussed its work there (Billett and Rice 2001). The site is now known as the Porcupine Abyssal Plain Sustained Observatory (PAP-SO). The site was chosen to be as far as possible from the influence of the continental slope to the east and the foothills of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the west. The aim was to reduce perturbations caused by slope-related process on the continental margin and the ocean ridge to a minimum. This allowed processes linking the sea surface to the abyssal seabed through the transfer of organic matter to be studied. The seabed depth at the sampling site ranges between 4800 and 4850 m. The site was a level area of seabed with little topographic and environmental heterogeneity. It had a strong seasonal signal in the flux of organic material (phytodetritus) (Billett et al. 1983).  2.2. Sampling - Sampling for megafauna was undertaken using a semi-balloon otter trawl (OTSB14). The wing-end spread was 8.6 m and the net height was approximately 1.5 m from the footrope to the headline. Towing speed was a nominal 0.75 ms?1. The net was constructed of a 44 mm stretch mesh in the main part a 37 mm stretch mesh in the central part and a 13 mm stretch mesh liner in the cod-end. Contact of the net with the seafloor and hence an estimate of the area fished was assessed by changes in wire tension during trawling operations. The acoustic beacon used with trawls between 1989 and 1999 to monitor performance was unavailable from 2000 onwards. We are nevertheless confident that our estimates of seafloor area fished remain consistent throughout the time series. On completion of a trawl samples were sorted into major taxonomic groups on board the ship before being fixed in 5% borax-buffered formaldehyde in seawater. The samples were transferred into 80% methylated spirit once the samples were returned to the laboratory. The samples were then sorted into finer taxonomic groups and wet weight and length was measured for each individual. Apart from sampling at the time series station in the middle of the Porcupine Abyssal Plain a number of other stations were sampled over the years to give spatial relevance (ca. 40?100 nm from PAP-SO). Specific sampling was undertaken deeper than 4800 m to the southeast east and north of the time series station (Fig. 1 Table 1). In addition advantage was taken of other trawling at abyssal depths closer to the base of the continental slope as part of science programmes conducted by the Oceanlab University of Aberdeen and the National Oceanography Centre Southampton. The samples came mainly from close to the mouth of the Porcupine Seabight (Fig. 1). This area had been sampled many times during the IOS Deep-Sea Biology Programme from 1976 to 1989 (Rice et al. 1991). Some of the larger abundant holothurians collected in the trawls namely Psychropotes longicauda O. mutabilis Pseudostichopus villosus and Paroriza prouhoi were enumerated and weighed at sea (fresh wet weight biomass) before the samples were used for other analyses in the years 1998 and 1999. Where this occurred the fresh wet weights were converted to preserved wet weight by applying a factor of 0.6 to the fresh wet weight in order to allow a comparison of wet weight biomass over the whole time series. Conand (1989) has shown that holothurians lose about 40% of their wet weight on preservation.

These transects were typically conducted seasonally but this frequency was variable due to logistical constraints. Linetransect photography was conducted using a Benthos 372 35mm film camera and Benthos 382 strobe mounted on a towed benthic camera sled at a height of 82 cm and 22.5? below horizontal (S1). The camera took photographs approximately every five s as the sled moved along the bottom at roughly 2.8 km h-1 creating a continuous image mosaic of the seafloor with overlapping frames. A semi-balloon otter trawl was towed behind the camera sled to non-quantitatively collect specimens from the line transect area. Collected specimens were then identified and used in part as a voucher collection to identify species in the line-transect photographs. The semi-balloon trawl had a 6.1 m opening and 3.8 cm stretch mesh net with a 1.3 cm mesh cod-end liner (S1). The photographs were evaluated using a Canadian grid system (S2) and the computer program DISTANCE (S3) which was based on line-transect theory (S4). The relative location of each individual along each transect was digitized. DISTANCE estimated the visibility of an object at a distance perpendicular to the centerline of the transect and provided a probability density function and effective strip width (ESW) for each species. The sum of non-overlapping distances between frames along the transect axis provided the transect length. Overlap was estimated by measuring the relative positions of a distinct object in sequential frames. The ESW was multiplied by the transect length to provide an estimation of abundance. When the abundance of any given group was below 15 individuals transect-1 an ESW from a species of similar visibility was used to estimate abundance. Detailed descriptions of the line-transect methodsapplied to the analysis of deep-sea camera sled photographs can be found in the supplemental reference materials (S5 S6).

These are all standard methods of collecting phytoplankton samples 1314 and many are still largely reliant on a phytoplankton manual written in 1978 15. A few samples were collected using automated samplers on moorings 16. The sampling was done via research vessels container ships and small boats by experienced researchers students and volunteers. The majority of the samples were preserved using Lugol?s solution although formalin paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde have also been used. Different methods of preservation can affect the condition of the sample and which taxa are well preserved 417. Samples were analysed with standard methods including light microscopy transmission or scanning electron microscopy which are described in Hallegraeff et al. 4. All methodological variations within our phytoplankton database are detailed in the metadata where available and recorded for each data entry. Where available a citation is referenced for each project which gives details on methodologies and limitations from that project (Table 1). There were three stages in data gathering. The first stage was to conduct a literature review of Australian phytoplankton data. Any literature that contained abundance or presence data was digitised and uploaded into the CSIRO maintained Oracle database. The second stage was to scan already existing databases such as the CSIRO data trawler the Ocean Biogeographic Ocean System (OBIS) and the Atlas of Living Australia (AOLA). These repositories only store presence records. Relevant data were selected and uploaded into the database. The third stage was to ask researchers to contribute any other data sets that they had. All data were organised into a standard format and uploaded into the database. Data were then served to and hosted by the AODN. All taxa have been verified as accepted species and given the currently accepted name as defined by the World Register of Marine Species database (WoRMS -http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=webservice). If any taxa could not be verified then a second check was done through AlgaeBase (http://www.algaebase.org/). If this did not verify that taxa as a valid name then the taxonomic level of identification was decreased to a satisfactory level or the entry removed. All abundance values were standardised to cells.L-1 or are given as presence only. Records of the original identifications and units were archived so any records can be checked. Identification of the smaller phytoplankton is often to a coarser taxonomic level as many cannot be distinguished to species using light microscopy. In some studies electron microscopy has been used to determine species but in other studies functional groups have been identified. This data set does not include accessory pigment data which can help resolve these smaller taxa 18 although it can be thought of as a complementary dataset. Over 20 years of pigment data are available in Australia via the AEsOP database (http://aesop.csiro.au/). Cell biovolume is calculated as per Hillebrand et al. 19 following the suggested shape factors for each genera. Size parameters were estimated from measurements taken from Australian samples or Australian references where available420 and other sources where not21-23. In some data sets direct measurements of size classes (e.g. P599 the Australian Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey and P597 the IMOS National Reference Stations) were used in preference to literature values. For some taxa there was insufficient information available to estimate a biovolume these were generally the rare taxa. Rather than estimate a size class without any information available these have been left blank. _____ Data Records: Each data record represents the abundance or presence of a phytoplankton taxa at a certain point in space and time and has been given a unique record identification number P(project_id)_(sample_id)_(record_id). Each data record belongs to a project with each project having a unique identification number Pxxx. A project is defined as a set of data records which have been collected together usually as a cruise or study with the same sampling method and having the same person counting the samples. Metadata ascribed to a project relates to all the data records within that project. Details to identify each separate project are given in Table 1. Each sample within that project has a unique sample_id. The sample_id has not been changed from the original data set to maintain traceability. So these may be duplicated between projects but P(project_id)_(sample_id) will be a unique entity in space and time. Species abundance records within the sample are given a unique record_id. The majority of these projects have been uploaded as part of the collation of data for this database. The IMOS National Reference Stations P599 and Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey P597 data which together constitute half the data in this database are available through the AODN (Data citation 12). Table 1 gives summary information on the project data sets their space time and taxonomic resolutions numbers of samples and records available. Users can select data sets from this information and download as desired through the AODN. _____ Technical Validation: The Phytoplankton Database will provide an extensive resource for phytoplankton researchers although there are some caveats due to the variety of the sampling and analysis protocols. The various sample collection methods infer that abundances might not always be directlycomparable across projects. For example quantitative methods such as bottle sampling (e.g. Project 599) will collect all but the rarest phytoplankton and will include the whole size spectrum whereas semi-quantitative methods such as net sampling are selective and dependent on tow method mesh size and the mix of species present in the water as some species may clog the net and trap smaller species that would otherwise go through the mesh (e.g. Project 509)21. By including all data collected using different methods and including this information as meta-data researchers are able to analyse the relative abundance of each taxa within a project and compare across compatible projects. Metadata includes as much detail as is available about sampling methods and limitations and provides guidance to the users about the potential of each data set. Users should consider collection methods preservation techniques and microscopic limitations when comparing datasets. All datasets have been standardised to taxa/m3 of water except P1070 where the units are taxa per gram of substrate measured. This project collected the phytoplankton by collecting substrates and analysing parts of the substrate. It is included here as the only data set on Gambierdiscus and associated benthic dinoflagellates from Australia which are important to the studies of the ciguatera. All datasets submitted can be interpreted as confirming the presence of those species recorded. In some datasets e.g. time series it is possible also to infer absences assuming that all species are looked for on each sampling occasion. Absences have been included in the data sets where the project information available allowed us the confidence to interpret such absences correctly. The interpretation of absences from other projects is at the discretion of the user. We suggest that a project-by-project approach should be taken. If a taxa is notobserved at all in a project then the absence could be due to the taxa not being present that taxa not being of interest to the analyst or the inability to identify that taxa. Thus a real absence should not be inferred. If a taxa is observed in some samples of a project it can most likely be assumed that the microscopist could identify the taxa and that a real absence may be inferred in samples within that project where the taxa was not marked as present. Some data records were removed when there was ambiguity as to the identification of the taxa i.e. when the taxonomic traceability usually from older sources was confused or whenspelling mistakes make it unclear which one of two species was meant. Species known as freshwater species were removed as the methods used to collect data were not aimed at freshwater environments and the inclusion of the odd records of these species would not be comprehensive or meaningful. Estuarine species were captured and the records kept. Data records with positions on land with an unreal number for abundance or with impossible dates were also removed or converted to presence records. ________ Usage Notes: The database contains information on the functional group of the species which can aid analysis. Functional groups include diatoms dinoflagellates flagellates ciliates (including tintinnids) silicoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Once downloaded and binned as required data are suitable for use in the creation of ecological indicators. For example: ? Total diatoms dinoflagellates ? Diatom:Dinoflagellate ratio ? Total phytoplankton abundance or biomass per degree square. Abundance (cells.L-1) for the phytoplankton counts is given where it is available providing  more information about the productivity of an area than presence data alone. A low cell abundance may indicate a low level or production but this may not be the case if these are large cells. The biomass data helps to show productivity of an area. The biovolume has been calculated for each cell count and when converted to biomass is available for use by modellers and to assist in interpretation of an area?s productivity. An accepted method of converting biovolume to biomass is to assume that the cell has the density of water (1 mm3 .L-1 = 1 mg.L- 1 ) 13. Another useful conversion is to carbon biomass,,NA,,,,,

We live-trapped nocturnal rodents twice each year (spring late summer) on trapping webs in upland prairie (GRASS) and saltbush-dominated (SHRUB) habitats. Three 3.14-ha webs were established in each habitat. Each web had 124 Sherman traps which were spaced 10-m apart on 12 100-m spokes with 30 degrees between spokes. Four traps were set in the center of the web. Traps were set for four consecutive nights in each trapping session. Traps are baited with a mix of peanut butter and oats set in the evening and checked (and closed) at dawn. We recorded sex age and weight upon first capture of all individuals. In the early years of the study individuals were batch-marked (Sharpie colored felt markers) to distinguish recaptures from new individuals providing the minimum information necessary to use distance-sampling methods to estimate density. Most nocturnal species are now usually marked with aluminum ear tags although we continue to mark very small (pocket mice) or small-eared (voles) species only with felt pens. For ear-tagged animals we distinguish new captures (N) from individuals marked during previous sessions (old O) versus those that are recaptured (R) on 2nd 3rd or 4th nights of a trapping session. The location of one trapping web was changed from 13NE (1994-1997) to 13SW (1998- present) because of concerns about intensive cattle use in the pasture as well as activity of CPER Site Manager?s cats. bird abundance calculated from annual censuses on 4 similar transects and bird abundance per km^2 exprapolated from these counts  Unit of abundance = IndCountInt, Unit of biomass = NA",censuses,NA,rows with spp names of . or  were removed.

A diver swims the length of the 40 m transect approximately 1m above the bottom at a constant deliberate speed and records all fish passing through the sampling area. Fish size is measured as total length (TL) estimated to the nearest cm. Care is taken by the diver to not count the same individual more than once if it leaves and re-enters the sampling area. Surveys are carried out by only a select number of highly trained divers whose sampling techniques have been standardized in order to minimize observer bias. The horizontal visibility along the transect is measured and recorded for each sampling event. The number of fish taxa sampled is not fixed as all species of reef fish encountered in the sampling area are recorded. Species that are difficult to identify underwater are lumped into broader taxonomic categories (e.g. flatfish in the family Bothidae) to facilitate sampling. Several species of small bottom-dwelling fish are difficult to accurately count and size during the reef fish survey due to their cryptic appearance and behavior. Individuals in a select group of these species are counted and sized in a separate survey done in the four contiguous 20 m x 1 m swaths that centered on the 40 m transect (Figure 1). A diver carefully searches the area within each swath taking time to look on the undersides of ledges and in crevices and within understory vegetation for select species of small cryptic fish which are purposely not counted in the reef fish survey.

Kartzinel,,tylerk@princeton.edu,,CC-by,http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E095/064/metadata.php,Ecology,Beginning in 2008 a series of three herbivory treatments and a control were randomly assigned to contiguous 1-ha plots replicated three times at each of three sites along a rainfall gradient (36 total plots). Any field experiment entails a trade-off between plot size and replication. Plot sizes of 1 ha are larger than those in many prior large-herbivore-exclusion studies and enabled us to include nine replicates of each plot type which was necessary both to sample multiple sites along the rainfall gradient and to achieve adequate statistical power. And although 1 ha is not large enough to detect all ecological effects of LMH (e.g. seed dispersal numerical responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH) it is adequate to document strong and consistent effects in many individual- population- and community-level responses of plants and small mammals (Goheen et al. 2013) as well as behavioral (as opposed to numerical) responses of smaller LMH to the exclusion of larger LMH (e.g. Young et al. 2005).

Survey number of times: Based on the record of 10 surveys of the past to the Ministry of the Environment shorebirds population fluctuation monitoring survey conducted in the (1999 to 2002) site type has been selected by the following criteria: In the core site species in order to grasp the maximum number of each time more accurately perform three or more times per survey period. In other general site but three or more of research is desirable if difficult it may be a one-time survey. Selection criteria of core site 1 - Ramsar wetlands in the registration or the East Asia and Australia that are participating in the regional shorebirds important habitat network. 2 - that you meet the Ramsar criteria (Appendix ?). 3 - East Asia and Australia that the entry criteria of local shorebirds important habitat network is more than more meets. 4 - countries designated wildlife sanctuary or that has been designated as an important wetland 500. 5- is that track record that provided the data to the investigation of the national level.

In brief a fixed-route walk (transect) is established at a site and butterflies are recorded along the route on a regular (weekly) basis under reasonable weather conditions for a number of years. Transect routes are chosen to sample evenly the habitat types and management activity on sites. Care is taken in choosing a transect route as it must then remain fixed to enable butterfly sightings to be compared from year to year. Transects are typically about 2-4km long taking between 45 minutes and two hours to walk and are divided into sections corresponding to different habitat or management units.Butterflies are recorded in a fixed width band (typically 5m wide) along the transect each week from the beginning of April until the end of September yielding ideally 26 counts per year. Transect walks are undertaken between 10.45am and 3.45pm and only when weather conditions are suitable for butterfly activity: dry conditions wind speed less than Beaufort scale 5 and temperature 13?C or greater if there is at least 60% sunshine or more than 17?C if overcast. Due to the vagaries of the British and Irish weather it is rare in practice to achieve a full set of 26 weekly counts. However a small number of missing values can be estimated using other counts during the season.Single species (as opposed to normal all species) transects have been increasingly established in recent years. Whilst such transects must follow the standard methodology and must record populations at least once a week throughout the flight period the focus on a single (or small number of) species reduces both the time required to walk each transect and more significantly the number of weekly counts. With many demands on the time of site management staff and volunteer recorders this reduced method has enabled population monitoring of particular threatened butterflies to be undertaken when otherwise it would not have been possible. By regularly recording a fixed route in standardised conditions the number of butterflies seen on a transect can be compared from year to year.

The preliminary list of vertebrate species from Bold Park has already been published (How & Dell 1990). This herpetofaunal survey of Bold Park was undertaken between December 1986 and June 1993 using four similar fenced pitfall traplines. The fenced pitfall traplines consisted of six pitfall traps placed in a linebetween 7 and 8 metres apart. Each pit trap consisted of a 17.5 cm diameter PVC pipe that was 60 cm deep and sealed at the bottom with fly-screen mesh. Drift fences that were 50 m long fly-screen mesh 30 cm high and dug 5 cm into the substrate crossed each of the 6 pitfall traps. Each pitfall trap open for 24 hours was referred to as a pit-day.

Prudic,jcoliver@email.arizona.edu,klprudic@email.arizona.edu,CC-by,http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E087/061/,ESA - Ecological Publications (Ecology),"This data paper documents surveys of butterfly diversity and abundance in grasslands of Boulder County Colorado during the years 1999 and 2000. The surveys were conducted on 66 established sites in the 10000 hectares managed by the Boulder Open Space Department (Bock and Bock 1994). These protected grassland sites are located in a green belt which surrounds the city of Boulder Colorado and include relictual tallgrass prairie lowland hayfields in floodplains and short- and mixed-grass prairies adjacent to foothill woodlands (Bock et al. 1995). These sites should remain free of development in the coming years providing a stable study area ideal for long-term monitoring. The data were used to analyze the effects of habitat characteristics and landscape context on grassland butterfly diversity and abundance (Collinge et al. 2003). The data set represents 7246 individuals of 58 butterfly species in 5 families. These data correspond to a majority of Boulder County grassland butterfly diversity and reflect the phenology of these species for the summer months of the two years sampled (A complete list of all butterfly species found in Boulder County can be found at the USGS Butterflies of North America web site [Opler et al. 1995]). The data set includes endangered butterfly species as well as surveys from rare habitat types (tallgrass prairie). These data are presented with the hope that they improve our understanding of large scale determinants of local and global abundances and diversity. Although these data alone do not constitute a long-term data set (2 years) and the temporal scale is slightly coarse (monthly) by using the standard sampling techniques presented here researchers may generate additional fine-scale (weekly) data to constitute a long-term data set. - Field/Laboratory: In brief we surveyed 66 sites in Boulder County Open Space Grasslands five times over two years: twice in 1999 (July and August) and three times in 2000 (June July August). Sites were sampled on sunny days between 1000 and 1600 hours. We used a modified line-transect method (Pollard 1977) to survey a 200-m-diameter circle (Collinge et al 2003). Each plot was divided into four quadrants of equal area and each quadrant was surveyed for 10 minutes by a trained observer. Beginning 20 paces from the center of the plot an observer walked over the entire area of the quadrant for 10 minutes. The first three to five individuals of each butterfly species observed were collected with butterfly nets and stored in glassine envelopes for the voucher collection. Individuals that could not be immediately identified were collected and identified at the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum. All butterfly species and their absolute abundance were recorded. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Entomology Collection of the University of Colorado Museum.

Site selection and evaluation: We used a design that allowed for an equal distribution of sampling locations. Spatially-balanced sampling approaches have recently been developed (e.g. Stevens and Olsen 2004 Olsen et al. 2012) that incorporate similar characteristics as random or systematic ones but also guarantee that all samples are evenly distributed across the entire sampling frame (rather than clumping commonly associated with random sampling or distinct intervals associated with systematic sampling). Sites were chosen from Floridas Statewide Seagrass polygon Geographic Information System (GIS) data set compiled by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission-Fish and Wildlife Research Institute Center for Spatial Analysis (FWRI 2007).  We used an Albers Equal Area projection for the shapefile. The file which includes all seagrass coverage across the state of Florida was clipped to include only the Big Bend region from the St. Marks River in the north and the Anclote River in the south. From the clipped polygon we then chose sites using the spsurvey package (Kincaid et al. 2008) in the R software environment (R Development Core Team 2008).

Sampling was done primarily between the hours of 14:00 and 20:00 (during the austral summer. the illuminated period is 24 h/day) by either peristaltic pump or Kemmerer bottle. Samples were collected in 1 l bottles and preserved immediately with Lugon's solution (American Public Health Association. 1985). Identification and counts were made with an inverted microscope by the method of Utermohl (1958). At least 100 individuals of the most numerous algae were counted per sample at 100x magnification. The total number of individuals counted was dependent on the number of taxa. but ranged between 200 and 500. Counting error ranged between 13 and 26%. depending on species. Algal species identifications were made using Geitler (1932). Seaburg et al. (1979) and Prescott (1962). Cell volumes were estimated for dominant taxa by measuring cell dimensions of 50-100 individuals and using closest geometric formulas of additional dates and depths to determine changes in cell volume over time. For rare taxa. volume estimates were made from fewer cell measurements.Primary productivity was measured using the method of Strickland and Parsons (1972). In situ 24 h incubations were made in triplicate 300 ml light and duplicate 300 ml dark bottles with Na14CO3 (3 uCi per 300 ml. New England Nuclear).

Diurnal samples were taken in triplicate at low spring tides with the chincha a traditionally used purse-seine-type net of the region (Nobre et al. 1915) and with 2.5 m fixed-frame-opening trawl in a 1.5-min tow. The area enclosed by the chincha was approximately 1500 m s at all stations except at VAG where it was 800 m s due to the narrow topographic configuration. Fishes were preserved by freezing. At the laboratory each specimen was identified according to the taxonomic keys of Whitehead et al. (1986) measured (total length) and weighed. The abundance biomass and species richness of the ichthyofauna were determined by sampling station. Fish were collected monthly from December 1996 to November 1997 at nine selected stations (Fig. 1) near the mouth of the lagoon (BAR GAF and SJA) at the edges of the main channels (ARE CAR and VAG) in the main freshwater area highly organically enriched (RIO) in the area showing the highest levels of industrial pollution (LAR) and approximately in the middle of the longest channel (TOR).  Samples were monthly taken in triplicate at low tide with a chincha a traditional beach-seine (Fig. 2). The area enclosed by the chincha was approximately 1000 m2 at all stations except at VAG where it was 800 m 2 due to a narrow topographic configuration. Stretched mesh sizes in the chincha were 19 mm at the wings 17 mm at the cod mouth 16 mm at the cod sleeve and 10 mm at the cod-end piece. Abiotic parameters (temperature and dissolved oxygen) were recorded with an oxygen meter (CONSORT Z621) salinity was recorded with a refractometer (ATAGO) and water transparency was estimated based on turbidity and Secchi depth according to Yanez-Arancibia et al. 1983 (in Rebelo 1992). Fishes were preserved by freezing. At the laboratory each specimen was identified according to the taxonomic keys of Bauchot and Pras (1987) and  Whitehead et al. (1986) measured (total length) and weighed (total weight). The abundance biomass and species richness of the ichthyofauna were determined by sampling station.  Fish were sampled monthly between November 1998 and November 2000 with a chincha a traditional beach-seine net. At each site and month three replicate samples were taken at low tide during the 5 days of the new moon at adjacent non-overlapping areas at nine sites.

The chincha gear used was almost rectangular in shape and composed by a central bag (a cod-end 295 cm of length and 145 cm of wide) two lateral wings (12 m of length each the width decreasing along the net reaching 50 cm at the edge and a central height of 1.5 m) two ropes (6.1 m each) and ?oating buoys at the top and ceramic weights at the bottom of the net. The end of the net was ?xed to the margin and the remainder was trawled in a semi-circle thus retaining within the cod-end all the ?sh from the area. The total area enclosed by the gear was estimated calculating the area of the semicircle of the lateral wings (93.6 m2) plus the area of the semi-circle of the cod-end (5.6 m2) plus the area of the rectangle formed by the two ropes (94.2 m2).

In particular, fire may increase grass and forb production while hindering shrub encroachment. Therefore, prescribed fires are a common management tool for maintaining grassland habitats in the southwest. However, Bouteloua eriopoda (black grama), a dominant species in Chihuahuan Desert grassland, is highly susceptible to fire resulting in death followed by slow recovery rates. A prescribed fire on the Sevilleta National Wildlife refuge in central New Mexico in 2003 provided the opportunity to study the effects of infrequent fires on vegetation in this region. This study was conducted along a transition zone where creosote bushes (Larrea tridentata) are encroaching on a black grama grassland. Before and after the fire, above ground plant productivity and composition were monitored from 2003 to present. Following the prescribed fire, there were fewer individual grass clumps and less above ground grass cover in burned areas compared to unburned areas. This decrease in productivity was primarily from a loss of B. eriopoda. Specifically, B. eriopoda density and cover were significantly lower following the fire with a slow recovery rate in the five years following the fire. Other grasses showed no such adverse response to burning.",,NA,,,,,
